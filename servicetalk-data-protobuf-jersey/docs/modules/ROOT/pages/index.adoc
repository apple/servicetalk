= Protobuf Serialization for Jersey
This module provides Protobuf serialization and deserialization for ServiceTalk Jersey router. This module bypasses
thee `InputStream` adaptation that kicks in with out-of-the-box body readers and also allows accepting/returning
`Single<MessageLite>` and `Publisher<MessageLite>` from resource methods.

CAUTION: This serializer can not currently be used with Server-Sent Events (SSE).

== Single Item Encoding
`Single` and Plain-Old-Protobufs are currently associated with the `application/x-protobuf` content encoding.

== VarInt Encoding
`Publisher` encoding currently uses
link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding[base 128 VarInt protobuf encoding] and is currently
associated with `application/x-protobuf-var-int` content encoding.
