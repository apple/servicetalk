= ServiceTalk

ServiceTalk is a JVM network application framework with APIs tailored to specific protocols (e.g. HTTP/1.x,
HTTP/2.x, etc...) and supports multiple programming paradigms.

It is built on link:https://netty.io[Netty] and is designed to provide most of the performance/scalability benefits of
Netty for common networking protocols used in service to service communication. ServiceTalk provides server support and
"smart client" like features such as client-side load balancing and service discovery integration.
