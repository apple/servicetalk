= OpenTelemetry Tracing

ServiceTalk provides comprehensive OpenTelemetry tracing support for HTTP and gRPC clients and servers through a set of filters that automatically instrument requests and responses.

== Overview

The `servicetalk-opentelemetry-http` module provides tracing filters that integrate with OpenTelemetry to automatically create spans for HTTP and gRPC operations, propagate trace context, and collect telemetry data.

IMPORTANT: The `servicetalk-opentelemetry-asynccontext` module must be on your classpath for proper async context propagation. You need to explicitly add both `servicetalk-opentelemetry-http` and `servicetalk-opentelemetry-asynccontext` as dependencies to your project.

== Key Components

=== Client-Side Tracing
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-opentelemetry-http/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/opentelemetry/http/OpenTelemetryHttpRequesterFilter.java[OpenTelemetryHttpRequesterFilter] - Client tracing filter for HTTP and gRPC

=== Server-Side Tracing
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-opentelemetry-http/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/opentelemetry/http/OpenTelemetryHttpServiceFilter.java[OpenTelemetryHttpServiceFilter] - Server tracing filter for HTTP and gRPC

=== Configuration
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-opentelemetry-http/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/opentelemetry/http/OpenTelemetryFilterBuilder.java[OpenTelemetryFilterBuilder] - Base builder for configuring tracing options

== Key Features

* **Automatic Span Creation**: Creates spans for HTTP and gRPC requests and responses following OpenTelemetry semantic conventions
* **Context Propagation**: Propagates trace context across service boundaries using standard headers
* **Configurable Attributes**: Capture custom request and response headers as span attributes
* **gRPC Support**: Specialized support for gRPC over HTTP/2 tracing
* **Filter Ordering**: Proper integration with ServiceTalk's filter chain for correct context handling

== Quick Start

NOTE: For complete dependency setup and OpenTelemetry SDK configuration, see the working examples in the ServiceTalk examples module.

=== Client Configuration

[source,java]
----
HttpClient client = HttpClients.forSingleAddress("example.com", 80)
    .appendClientFilter(new OpenTelemetryHttpRequesterFilter.Builder()
        .componentName("my-client")
        .capturedRequestHeaders(Arrays.asList("user-agent", "x-request-id"))
        .capturedResponseHeaders(Arrays.asList("content-type", "x-response-id"))
        .build())
    .build();
----

=== Server Configuration

[source,java]
----
HttpServerBuilder.forAddress(localAddress(0))
    // IMPORTANT: Use non-offloading filter for proper context propagation
    .appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter(new OpenTelemetryHttpServiceFilter.Builder()
        .capturedRequestHeaders(Arrays.asList("user-agent", "x-request-id"))
        .capturedResponseHeaders(Arrays.asList("content-type"))
        .build())

    // Add request draining AFTER OpenTelemetry filter
    .appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter(HttpRequestAutoDrainingServiceFilter.INSTANCE)

    .listen(service);
----

== Advanced Configuration

=== Capturing Custom Headers

[source,java]
----
// Capture specific request and response headers as span attributes
OpenTelemetryHttpRequesterFilter filter = new OpenTelemetryHttpRequesterFilter.Builder()
    .componentName("my-client")
    .capturedRequestHeaders(Arrays.asList("x-custom-header", "authorization"))
    .capturedResponseHeaders(Arrays.asList("x-response-id", "content-type"))
    .build();
----

== Filter Ordering Guidelines

Proper filter ordering is crucial for OpenTelemetry tracing to work correctly with other ServiceTalk features.

=== Server Filters

For servers, use non-offloading filters for proper context propagation and pay special attention to filter ordering:

[source,java]
----
HttpServerBuilder.forAddress(localAddress(0))
    // OpenTelemetry filter MUST be first for proper context propagation
    .appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter(new OpenTelemetryHttpServiceFilter.Builder()
        .build())

    // Request draining filter MUST come after OpenTelemetry filter
    // This ensures tracing information is captured for auto-drained requests
    .appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter(HttpRequestAutoDrainingServiceFilter.INSTANCE)

    // Exception mapping should come after tracing to ensure correct status codes
    .appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter(HttpExceptionMapperServiceFilter.INSTANCE)

    // Other filters can follow
    .listen(service);
----

**Important:** The `HttpRequestAutoDrainingServiceFilter` must be placed *after* the OpenTelemetry filter. This is critical for server-side tracing accuracy, particularly for requests like GET where the request body is typically ignored. If auto-draining occurs before the OpenTelemetry filter processes the request, tracing information may be incomplete or incorrect.

=== Client Filters

When using multiple filters on clients, place the OpenTelemetry filter appropriately in the chain:

[source,java]
----
HttpClient client = HttpClients.forSingleAddress("example.com", 80)
    // Logging or other observability filters before tracing
    .appendClientFilter(loggingFilter)

    // OpenTelemetry filter for span creation and context propagation
    .appendClientFilter(new OpenTelemetryHttpRequesterFilter.Builder()
        .componentName("my-client")
        .build())

    // Retry and other resilience filters after tracing
    .appendClientFilter(retryFilter)
    .build();
----

=== Filter Ordering Best Practices

1. **OpenTelemetry filters should be among the first filters** to ensure proper context establishment
2. **Use non-offloading filters** (`appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter`) for OpenTelemetry filters on the server-side to ensure earlier context establishment
3. **Request draining must come after OpenTelemetry** on the server side
4. **Exception mapping should come after OpenTelemetry** to ensure trace status reflects actual response codes
5. **Lifecycle observers should come after OpenTelemetry** to see correct span information

== Context Propagation

OpenTelemetry context is automatically propagated through multiple mechanisms to ensure traces are correlated correctly across service boundaries and async operations.

=== Header Propagation

OpenTelemetry context is automatically injected into and extracted from headers using the standard OpenTelemetry propagation format:

* **W3C Trace Context** (`traceparent`, `tracestate` headers)
* **B3 Propagation** (if configured)
* **Custom propagators** (if configured in the OpenTelemetry SDK)

[source,java]
----
// Context is automatically propagated via headers
HttpResponse response = client.request(client.get("/api/endpoint"));
// The server will receive trace context via HTTP headers
----

=== Async Context Integration

ServiceTalk's async context system ensures OpenTelemetry context is maintained across:

* **Thread boundaries** during async operations
* **Publisher/Subscriber chains** in reactive streams
* **Executor transitions** when work is offloaded
* **Filter chains** where context must be preserved

This integration is provided by the `servicetalk-opentelemetry-asynccontext` module, which implements the `CapturedContextProvider` interface.

=== Context Scope Management

OpenTelemetry spans are automatically activated and deactivated at appropriate points:

[source,java]
----
// Client side: span is active during request processing
client.request(client.get("/api"))
    .beforeOnSuccess(response -> {
        // Current span is still active here
        Span currentSpan = Span.current();
        currentSpan.setStatus(StatusCode.OK);
    });

// Server side: span is active during service method execution
service.handle((ctx, request, responseFactory) -> {
    // Current span is active and contains trace context from client
    Span currentSpan = Span.current();
    currentSpan.addEvent("Processing request");
    return responseFactory.ok();
});
----

== gRPC Support

The tracing filters provide specialized support for gRPC over HTTP/2:

* Automatic detection of gRPC requests
* gRPC-specific span naming and attributes
* Proper status code mapping

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

**Context Not Propagating**
Ensure `servicetalk-opentelemetry-asynccontext` is on the classpath and the filter is properly ordered.

**Missing Spans**
Verify OpenTelemetry is properly configured and the global OpenTelemetry instance is set.
