/**
 * Helper operator for signaling the end of an HTTP Request/Response cycle.
 *
 * <p>{@link StreamingHttpRequest} and {@link StreamingHttpResponse} are nested sources ({@link Single} of meta-data
 * containing a payload {@link Publisher}), which makes it non-trivial to get a single signal at the end of this
 * Request/Response cycle. One needs to consider and coordinate between the multitude of outcomes: cancel/success/error
 * across both sources.</p>
 * <p>This operator ensures that the provided callback is triggered just once whenever the sources reach a terminal
 * state across both sources. An important question is when the ownership of the callback is transferred from the
 * {@link Single} source and the payload {@link Publisher}. In this case ownership is transferred the first time the
 * payload is subscribed to. This means that if a cancellation of the response {@link Single} occurs after the response
 * has been emitted but before the message body has been subscribed to, the callback will observe a cancel. However, if
 * the message payload has been subscribed to, the cancellation of the {@link Single} will have no effect and the result
 * is dictated by the terminal event of the payload body. If the body is subscribed to multiple times, only the first
 * subscribe will receive ownership of the terminal events.</p>
 *
 * Example usage tracking the begin and end of a request:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     // coarse grained, any terminal signal calls the provided `Runnable`
 *     return requester.request(strategy, request)
 *                     .beforeOnSubscribe(__ -> tracker.requestStarted())
 *                     .liftSync(new BeforeFinallyHttpOperator(tracker::requestFinished));
 *
 *     // fine grained, `tracker` implements `TerminalSignalConsumer`, terminal signal indicated by the callback method
 *     return requester.request(strategy, request)
 *                     .beforeOnSubscribe(__ -> tracker.requestStarted())
 *                     .liftSync(new BeforeFinallyHttpOperator(tracker));
 * }</pre>
