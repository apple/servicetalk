     * Toggles the server's channel accepting connection ability.

     * Passing a {@code false} value, will stop accepting connections on the server channel, without affecting any other
     * interaction to currently open child channels (i.e., reads / writes).
     * <p>
     * Depending on the transport, connections may still get ESTABLISHED, see.
     * {@link ServiceTalkSocketOptions#SO_BACKLOG backlog} and (in case of Linux)
     * <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt">SOMAXCONN</a>.
     * For instance, in case of TCP the 3-way handshake may finish, and the connection will await in the
     * accept queue to be accepted. If the accept queue is full, connection SYNs will await in the
     * SYN backlog (i.e., in case of Linux <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt">
     * tcp_max_syn_backlog</a>). These additional parameters may affect the behavior of new flows when the service
     * is not accepting.
     * <p>
     * Depending on how long this stays in the {@code false} state, it may affect other timeouts (i.e., connect-timeout
     * or idleness) on the peer-side and/or the other flows to the peer (i.e., proxies).
     * <p>
     * Considerations:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Upon resumption, {@code accept == true}, backlogged connections will be processed first,
     * which may be inactive by that time.</li>
     * <li>The effect of toggling connection acceptance may be lazy evaluated (implementation detail), meaning
     * that connections may still go through even after setting this to {@code false}.</li>
     * </ul>
     * @param accept Toggles the server's accepting connection ability.
