= Jersey HTTP Router

ServiceTalk offers JAX-RS support via its Jersey HTTP router module.
This module gives access to all JAX-RS features and also to a set of
ServiceTalk specific extensions. This document details these features
and also delves deeper into the implementation.

== Features

In its simplest form, starting a ServiceTalk server with the Jersey
router amounts to:

[source,java]
----
HttpServers.forPort(8080)
    .listenStreamingAndAwait(new HttpJerseyRouterBuilder().build(jaxrsApplication))
    .awaitShutdown()
----

where `jaxrsApplication` is any implementation of
`javax.ws.rs.core.Application`, including sub-classes of
`org.glassfish.jersey.server.ResourceConfig` if the intention is to use
Jersey-specific features.

=== Standard Resources

The Jersey Router allows ServiceTalk to support a variety of JAX-RS features,
which we detail in this section.

As expected, standard JAX-RS-annotated resource classes and methods can be used,
like the following:

[source,java]
----
@Path("greetings")
public class HelloWorldJaxRsResource {
    @GET
    @Path("hello")
    @Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@DefaultValue("world") @QueryParam("who") final String who) {
        return "hello " + who;
    }
}
----

Any off-the-shelf entity provider can be used immediately. For example
the following code works as expected if a JSON media type provider (like
Jersey’s `jersey-media-json-jackson`) is on the classpath:

[source,java]
----
@POST
@Path("hello")
@Consumes(APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(APPLICATION_JSON)
public Map<String, String> hello(final Map<String, String> salutation) {
    return singletonMap("hello", salutation.getOrDefault("who", "world"));
}
----

Asynchronous processing with `CompletionStage` and the older model based
on `AsyncResponse` are both supported. Here is an example with
`CompletionStage`:

[source,java]
----
@Consumes(APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(APPLICATION_JSON)
@Path("hello")
@POST
public CompletionStage<Map<String, String>> hello(final Map<String, String> salutation) {
    return completedFuture(singletonMap("hello", salutation.getOrDefault("who", "world")));
}
----

NOTE: Server-Sent Events are also fully supported.

=== ServiceTalk Aware Resources

In addition to standard JAX-RS, the Jersey router
also allows users to take full advantage of ServiceTalk asynchronous primitives.

Indeed, the router supports a few ServiceTalk-specific features whose
usage is optional, but that can be interesting for users who want to use
Reactive Streams concepts in their resources or want to deal with
ServiceTalk types like `Buffer`.

By default, Jersey supports `byte[]` request/response entities.
ServiceTalk uses a higher level abstraction called `Buffer` and the
router lets you use it in your resources. Doing so has the main
advantage of completely bypassing the <<io-adapt>> layer used internally
between ServiceTalk streams and the blocking `Input/OutputStream` that
are used pervasively in Jersey.

To be more specific, ServiceTalk allows
consuming and producing the following entities (in addition to standard
JAX-RS entities):

* `Buffer` — the aggregated request or response body,
* `Single<Buffer>` — the aggregated request or response body as an async
source,
* `Publisher<Buffer>` — the request or response body as an async stream
of `Buffer`s.

CAUTION: Using `Buffer` and async payloads will prevent off-the-shelf
payload-aware <<filter-inter>> from working properly.
Moreover, such payloads can not currently be used with Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Let's look at some examples.
The first one is a rewrite of the previous `hello` example but,
this time, returning `Buffer` instead of `String`:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("hello")
@Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
public Buffer hello(@DefaultValue("world") @QueryParam("who") final String who) {
    return DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR.fromUtf8("hello " + who);
}
----

Real benefits come when using async sources in and out, as shown here:

[source,java]
----
@POST
@Path("hello")
@Consumes(TEXT_PLAIN)
@Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
public Single<Buffer> hello(final Single<Buffer> who,
                            @Context final ConnectionContext ctx) {
    final BufferAllocator allocator = ctx.executionContext().bufferAllocator();
    return who.map(b -> allocator.newCompositeBuffer()
            .addBuffer(allocator.fromAscii("hello, "))
            .addBuffer(b)
            .addBuffer(allocator.fromAscii("!")));
}
----

The advantage of this approach is that the resource method only takes
care of assembling the response as an execution chain: ServiceTalk is
fully in charge of executing it. This enables advanced features like
executing on the I/O executor for non-blocking scenarios (discussed
later in the <<execution-strategies>> section).

Notice how the example above receives a `ConnectionContext` instance via
a `@Context`-annotated method parameter. This is one of the two
ServiceTalk-specific context objects that you can receive via `@Context`
injection (on top of all the standard JAX-RS ones like `HttpHeaders`,
`UriInfo` or `SecurityContext`):

* `ConnectionContext` — gives access to connection meta information,
executors and allocator,
* `StreamingHttpRequest` — the ServiceTalk-specific representation of
the in-flight HTTP request.

WARNING: The `@Context`-provided objects are only available to the same thread
that has called the resource method. This is why the `allocator` is
dereferenced and stored in a variable before behind used in the async
execution chain in the above example.

NOTE: ServiceTalk does not yet have a compatibility layer for Servlet,
thus objects like `ServletConfig` or `HttpServletRequest` are not available
via `@Context` injection.

Assembling complete responses in a single `Buffer` is not practical for large payloads.
This is when streaming the response with a `Publisher` comes handy,
as shown in the following examples that produces a streaming response of `Buffer`s:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("hello")
@Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
public Response hello(@DefaultValue("world") @QueryParam("who") final String who,
                      @Context final ConnectionContext ctx) {
    final BufferAllocator allocator = ctx.executionContext().bufferAllocator();
    return Response.accepted(
            // Wrap content Publisher to capture its generic type (i.e. Buffer)
            // so it is handled correctly
            new GenericEntity<Publisher<Buffer>>(
                Publisher.from(allocator.fromUtf8("hello "),
                               allocator.fromUtf8(who))) {}
    ).build();
}
----

Notice that in this example how the standard `Response` and
`GenericEntity` helpers can be used as with any vanilla JAX-RS resource.

==== CompletionStage Alternative

It is also possible to use ServiceTalk's primitives in lieu of `CompletionStage`,
allowing users to use consistent semantics and behavior across their async code.
As an example, the following illustrates how `Completable` can be used in place of
`CompletionStage<Void>`:

[source,java]
----
@POST
@Path("start")
public Completable start(@QueryParam("id") final String id) {
    // Do something with id
    return Completable.completed();
}
----

Similarly, this example shows that `Single<String>` can replace
`CompletionStage<String>`:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("hello")
@Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
public Single<String> hello(@DefaultValue("world") @QueryParam("who") final String who) {
    return Single.succeeded("hello " + who);
}
----

=== ServiceTalk JSON Provider

ServiceTalk provides a JSON Provider (`servicetalk-data-jackson-jersey`)
that can be used as a drop-in
replacement for Jersey’s `jersey-media-json-jackson`. It is based on
Jackson’s non-blocking JSON parser and completely bypasses the blocking
<<io-adapt>> layer that’s otherwise used with
standard JAX-RS media-type providers. This can yield performance
benefits when dealing with large body entities and also enables fully
non-blocking routes.

The following example shows what this provider enables:

[source,java]
----
@POST
@Path("single-hello")
@Consumes(APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(APPLICATION_JSON)
public Single<Map<String, String>> singleHello(final Single<Map<String, String>> salutation) {
    return salutation.map(m -> singletonMap("single hello", m.getOrDefault("who", "world")));
}
----

Jackson-serializable POJOs could be used in place of the ``Map``s used in
this example.

IMPORTANT: ServiceTalk’s JSON provider doesn’t support JAXB annotations nor
JSONP. Use Jersey’s `jersey-media-json-jackson` in case you need these
features

The Jackson `ObjectMapper` used behind the scene can be configured via a
JAX-RS `ContextResolver` of type
`ContextResolver<JacksonSerializationProvider>` that needs to be
provided with the application. The `ServiceTalkJacksonSerializerFeature`
class has helper methods for building such `ContextResolver` instances.

NOTE: Because Jackson is used behind the scene for serialization and
deserialization, it is possible to use its annotations (for example
`@JsonProperty`).

[[filter-inter]]
=== Filters and Interceptors

Standard JAX-RS filters and interceptors can be used with ServiceTalk.

JAX-RS request filters and interceptors can only access the entity as an
`InputStream`, which can be suboptimal if the intention is to avoid
blocking I/O. If that is the case, consider using a ServiceTalk filter
on front of the Jersey router.

Conversely, response entities are accessible to JAX-RS filters and
interceptors, so it is possible to write filters that alter contents in
a non-blocking fashion, as demonstrated here:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void filter(final ContainerRequestContext requestCtx, final ContainerResponseContext responseCtx) {
    final Publisher<Buffer> modifiedContent =
            ((Publisher<Buffer>) responseCtx.getEntity()).map(b -> modifyBuffer(b));
    responseCtx.setEntity(new GenericEntity<Publisher<Buffer>>(modifiedContent) {});
}
----

In this example, it is assumed that the response entity is a
`Publisher<Buffer>`: the `Buffer` it emits are altered via calls to the
`modifyBuffer` function (omitted for brevity).

=== Security

By default, the Jersey router establishes an unauthenticated security
context for all requests. Standard JAX-RS filters can be used to
override this and set authenticated security contexts where appropriate.
The following is an example of such filter, which could be used either
globally, per resource class or method, using standard JAX-RS mapping
techniques:

[source,java]
----
@Provider
@Priority(AUTHENTICATION)
public static class CustomSecurityFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {
    @Override
    public void filter(final ContainerRequestContext requestCtx) {
        requestCtx.setSecurityContext(new CustomSecurityContext(requestCtx));
    }
}
----

NOTE: ServiceTalk provides security filters that can be used with Basic authenticated requests.
Refer to xref:servicetalk-http-security-jersey::index.adoc#auth-basic[Basic Auth for Jersey Router] for more information.

=== Exception Mappers

Standard JAX-RS exception mappers can be used with ServiceTalk. On top
of this, it is possible to use ServiceTalk-specific response entities as
error payloads, as shown here:

[source,java]
----
public static class ServiceTalkAwareExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<Throwable> {
    @Context
    private ConnectionContext ctx;

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(final Throwable t) {
        final Buffer buf = ctx.executionContext().bufferAllocator().fromAscii(exception.getClass().getName());
        return status(555)
                .header(CONTENT_TYPE, TEXT_PLAIN)
                .header(CONTENT_LENGTH, buf.readableBytes())
                .entity(new GenericEntity<Single<Buffer>>(success(buf)) {})
                .build();
    }
}
----

=== Injection Management

By default the Jersey router doesn’t transitively bring a particular
Jersey Injection Manager dependency, it is up to the user to pick one of
the available implementations by adding the relevant dependency to the
application classpath.

Jersey provides two implementations:

* `jersey-hk2` — based on HK2, this is the most likely implementation
that will be used with ServiceTalk,
* `jersey-inject-cdi2-se` - relying CDI, this is to be used when running
ServiceTalk in a Java EE application container.

=== ServiceTalk Features

The ServiceTalk JAX-RS `Feature` that enables the router functionalities
is automatically registered with Jersey using its
https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/deployment.html#deployment.autodiscoverable[auto-discoverable features].

If this router is used in a context where Jersey’s auto-discovery has
been disabled, users must manually register
`io.servicetalk.http.router.jersey.ServiceTalkFeature` with the JAX-RS
`FeatureContext`. Note that if the ServiceTalk JSON provider is used,
its feature would have to be registered too:
`io.servicetalk.data.jackson.jersey.ServiceTalkJacksonSerializerFeature`

== Advanced Features

=== Service Composability

`HttpJerseyRouterBuilder` builds a standard ServiceTalk HTTP service
so it can be composed with any other ServiceTalk services or filters.

The following example illustrates this be showing how a service built
with `HttpJerseyRouterBuilder` can be seamlessly used alongside another
regular ServiceTalk HTTP service, inside a single predicate based router:

[source,java]
----
ServerContext serverContext = HttpServers.forPort(8080)
        .listenStreamingAndAwait(
                new HttpPredicateRouterBuilder()
                        .whenPathStartsWith("/healthcheck")
                        .thenRouteTo(healthService)
                        .whenPathStartsWith("/api")
                        .thenRouteTo(new HttpJerseyRouterBuilder().build(jaxRsApplication))
                        .buildStreaming()
        );
----

[#execution-strategies]
=== Execution Strategies

TIP: It is important to have a good understanding of ServiceTalk's threading model
before considering tuning execution strategies.
Refer to ServiceTalk's xref:servicetalk::index.adoc[main documentation]
to learn more about it.

By default, the Jersey router uses ServiceTalk’s global executor to
handles requests, making it safe by default to use blocking code, either
directly in user code or indirectly in third-party libraries and
intermediaries like filters, interceptors and media-type providers.

It is possible to use a specific executor for all requests handled by
the Jersey router, as demonstrated here:

[source,java]
----
HttpServers.forPort(8080)
    .executionStrategy(HttpExecutionStrategies.defaultStrategy(executor))
    .listenStreamingAndAwait(new HttpJerseyRouterBuilder().build(jaxrsApplication))
    .awaitShutdown();
----

where `executor` is the executor to use at the router level.

It is also possible to configure execution strategies in a finer grained
manner, either at resource class or resource method level, using the
`@RouteExecutionStrategy` annotation. For example, the following applies
the execution strategy `exec-1` to a specific resource method:

[source,java]
----
@RouteExecutionStrategy(id = "exec-1")
@POST
@Path("/do-work")
public void doWork() {
    // Work happens here
}
----

Now the question is where does the Jersey router find its execution
strategies? The answer is in this `HttpJerseyRouterBuilder` method:

[source,java]
----
routeExecutionStrategyFactory(Function<String, HttpExecutionStrategy> routeStrategyFactory)
----

This allows you to provide a lambda that the router will use to resolve
execution strategy IDs used in `@RouteExecutionStrategy` annotations
(`map::get` can conveniently be used if you store your strategy mappings
in a `Map`).

IMPORTANT: The router ensures it can resolve all execution strategy
IDs at startup time.

By default ServiceTalk is "safe to block", which means that it takes
care of ensuring that the application code doesn’t execute on the I/O
threads (which shouldn’t be blocked). This applies to the Jersey router
too: resources, filters, interceptors can perform blocking operations,
like for example interacting with `java.io` streams, in a safe manner.
This safety has a cost though: different executors are used at different
levels, thread hops may occur while a request is in flight, etc…
ServiceTalk gives advanced users the possibility to bypass this safety
net and execute application code fully or partially on the I/O executor.

Before exploring this in details, let’s take a look at an example that
completely runs on I/O threads. The following snippet shows the server
bootstrap code and followed by one JAX-RS resource method:

[source,java]
----
HttpServers.forPort(8080)
    .executionStrategy(HttpExecutionStrategies.noOffloadsStrategy())
    .listenStreamingAndAwait(new HttpJerseyRouterBuilder().build(jaxrsApplication))
    .awaitShutdown();

@NoOffloadsRouteExecutionStrategy
@Path("greetings")
public class HelloWorldJaxRsResource {
    @GET
    @Path("hello")
    @Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@DefaultValue("world") @QueryParam("who") final String who) {
        return "hello " + who;
    }
}
----

Notice how `HttpExecutionStrategies.noOffloadsStrategy()` and
`@NoOffloadsRouteExecutionStrategy` are used conjointly to ensure that
offloading will be completely disabled and that the requests will be fully handled on I/O threads.

WARNING: Disabling offloading should only be done when it is certain that no blocking code will be invoked.
Request handling in Jersey follows a complicated and dynamic path, so unexpected blocking can occur in non-user code.
Be sure to thoroughly test the routes for which you intend to disable offloading.

IMPORTANT: It is currently not possible to disable offloading if any JAX-RS resource uses `@Suspended AsyncResponse`,
`CompletionStage` responses or Server-Sent Events. A workaround for this consists in using the Predicate router
to selectively offload such resources, as shown in this link:{sourceroot}servicetalk-http-router-jersey/src/testFixtures/java/io/servicetalk/http/router/jersey/MixedModeResourceTest.java[test]

These different options combined together yield different effects at
different level of the application code. The following table details
what to expect when using them.

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]

Where:

* `Route` means either a resource class or resource method (where both
`@RouteExecutionStrategy` and `@NoOffloadsRouteExecutionStrategy` can be
used),
* `Router` is the Jersey router,
* `Global` refers to ServiceTalk’s `GlobalExecutionContext` (which
provides among other things global I/O and standard executors),
* `Server I/O` refers to the I/O executor configured on the HTTP server
(which is the global I/O executor by default),
* `M` stands for the executor used to call the resource `Method`,
* `C` for the one provided via `@Context ConnectionContext`,
* `S` refers to the executor used for stream events.

Users must exercise caution if they decide to execute on the I/O threads
and must make sure they understand the caveats of doing so. Resources
that only serve responses from memory or that interact with remote
services via ServiceTalk are good potential candidates.

WARNING: Be aware that route level execution strategy are applied after the
JAX-RS filter chain has executed. If any of these JAX-RS filters perform
blocking operations (for example blocking I/O) you must make sure that
the Jersey router itself is not configured to use I/O threads, thus
limiting the potential to run on I/O threads only to stream events
(`Router Default/Executor` and `Route No Offloads` in the above table).

== Implementation

This section details the design and implementation decisions taken for
the Jersey router. It is intended for contributors and advanced users
interested to know what’s under the hood.

The following diagram gives a lay of the land for request/response flows in
the router, with a short description of the salient operations performed by
ServiceTalk at the different spots in the flow.

image:st2-jersey-flow.png[]

The upcoming sections expand more on some of the concepts depicted in this diagram.


NOTE: As Jersey’s and ServiceTalk’s Jersey router codebases evolve, we expect
some of the drawbacks listed hereafter to progressively disappear.

[[io-adapt]]
=== Input/OutputStream Adaptation

JAX-RS 2.1 depends heavily on `java.io.Input/OutputStream` for consuming
request and producing response entity contents. The Jersey router uses
ServiceTalk’s provided adapters to convert between its non-blocking
sources and these blocking streams. This adaptation is what allows using
all the Jersey-provided and third party media-type providers to work out
of the box.

For request payloads, the Jersey router uses a special `InputStream`
(namely `BufferPublisherInputStream`), which allows accessing the
underlying `Publisher<Buffer>` for scenarios when the `InputStream`
needs not be accessed.

For response payloads, the implementation is slightly more involved but
in essence provides the same bypass capacity when `OutputStream`-writing
isn't required (users can look at `DefaultContainerResponseWriter`'s source
code for more information).

NOTE: At this writing, all byte arrays written via the
`java.io.OutputStream` adaptation layer have to be copied because of the
way Jersey internally reuses buffers.

This adaptation is automatically bypassed when a resource method
consumes or produces an entity type that can be directly handled by
ServiceTalk, like for example `Single<Buffer>`.

There are subtle edge cases where filters or interceptors can affect
this adaptation mechanism by replacing the entity body created by the
router at the start of the request handling chain. Mitigation is in
place to circumvent these issues: readers are invited to turn to the
JavaDoc of `io.servicetalk.http.router.jersey.internal.SourceWrappers`
for the gory details.

=== Endpoint Swapping

While most features of the Jersey router are implemented via JAX-RS
constructs, some advanced features, like the ones listed here, needed to
be wired deep in the insides of the Jersey handling chain:

* `Single` and `Completable` response entity types (as alternative to
`CompletionStage`),
* per-route execution strategies.

This "deep wiring" is done by replacing the `Endpoint` that Jersey
uses to invoke user code right at the end of its internal request
process chain, with a custom `Endpoint` that wraps the original and
intercepts the execution when one of the two above scenarios is in use.

This interception is achieved by using the suspend/resume mechanism that
is normally used for JAX-RS async responses, which is why AsyncResponse
and Server-Sent Events can’t be used with these advanced features (it’s
also why `CompletionStage` can’t be used with per-route execution
strategies).

The replacement of the original `Endpoint` is done via a JAX-RS filter
whose priority is the lowest possible (`Integer.MAX_VALUE` because the
lower the number, the higher priority) so it executes at the end of the
filter chain.

CAUTION: A corollary of this approach is that this mechanism could fail in
case other "lowest possible" filters are in use.

For response filters to work properly, the original `Endpoint` has to be
swapped back into placed after the resource method has been invoked.
This is because, although the router replacement endpoint implements
Jersey’s `Endpoint` and `ResourceInfo` interface, Jersey’s
infrastructure perform instance checks against `ResourceMethodInvoker`
(its own `Endpoint` implementation) in the logic that applies response
filters. This unfortunately leaves no option other than restoring the
original `ResourceMethodInvoker` after ServiceTalk’s endpoint has served
its purpose.
