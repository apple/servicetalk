= Evolving to asynchronous

Evolution to full asynchronous routes is elaborated xref:{page-version}@servicetalk-http-api::evolve-to-async.adoc[here].
This document describes the capabilities of jersey router with respect to specifying strategy per route.

== Explicit route strategy

Jersey router provides xref:index.adoc#execution-strategies[annotations] to specify execution strategies for each route.

== Implicit route strategy

Jersey router currently does not have the capability to infer an execution strategy for a route implicitly.
