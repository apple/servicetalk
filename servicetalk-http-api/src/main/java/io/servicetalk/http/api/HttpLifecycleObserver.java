/**
 * An observer interface that provides visibility into HTTP lifecycle events.
 * <p>
 * In order to deliver events at accurate time, callbacks on this interface can be invoked from the {@link IoExecutor}.
 * Implementation of this observer <b>must</b> be non-blocking. If the consumer of events may block (uses a blocking
 * library or <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/async.html">logger configuration is not async</a>),
 * it has to offload publications to another {@link Executor} <b>after</b> capturing timing of events. If blocking code
 * is executed inside callbacks without offloading, it will negatively impact {@link IoExecutor} and overall performance
 * of the application.
 * <p>
 * To install this observer for the server use {@link HttpServerBuilder#lifecycleObserver(HttpLifecycleObserver)}, for
 * the client use {@link SingleAddressHttpClientBuilder#appendClientFilter(StreamingHttpClientFilterFactory)} with
 * {@code io.servicetalk.http.netty.HttpLifecycleObserverRequesterFilter}.
