= Blocking safe by default

This document elaborates how HTTP APIs provide ways to influence offloading. General philosophy of writing blocking code
while using ServiceTalk is explained xref:{page-version}@servicetalk::blocking-safe-by-default.adoc[here] and is a recommended read.

== An optimal execution strategy

As described in xref:{page-version}@servicetalk::blocking-safe-by-default.adoc#influencing-offloading-decisions[Influencing offloading
decisions], ServiceTalk tries to calculate an optimal execution strategy based on various inputs. This section describes
how this calculation is done for those inputs.

=== Streaming core

ServiceTalk core is based on the asynchronous streaming programming model and hence exposes different points where user
code may interact with the event loop.

(Refer to xref:{page-version}@servicetalk-concurrent-api::blocking-safe-by-default.adoc#data-and-control-flow-in-an-execution-chain[this document] to understand
data and control signals terminology).

==== Client

Considering the request method for
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-http-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/http/api/StreamingHttpClient.java[`StreamingHttpClient`]

```java
Single<StreamingHttpResponse> request(StreamingHttpRequest request);
```
we have the following points that require offloads:

. Data signals for the response `Single`.
. Data signals for the response payload `Publisher`.
. Control signals for the request payload `Publisher`.

==== Server

Considering the handle method for
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-http-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/http/api/StreamingHttpService.java[`StreamingHttpService`]

```java
Single<StreamingHttpResponse> handle(HttpServiceContext ctx, StreamingHttpRequest request,
                                     StreamingHttpResponseFactory responseFactory);
```
we have the following points that require offloads:

. Call to `handle()`
. Control signals for the response `Single`.
. Control signals for the response payload `Publisher`.
. Data signals for the request payload `Publisher`.

=== Programming models

xref:{page-version}@servicetalk::programming-paradigms.adoc[Programming Paradigms] plays an important role in
determining an appropriate offloading strategy since they naturally omit some paths that user code can not interact with
the event loop. The following matrix elaborates the paths which require offloading with a (✓) and which do not with a (✗).

=== User code

Any user code that is added to the processing of client/server is considered suspicious by ServiceTalk and hence any
offloading optimizations as described above may get de-optimized. Examples of such code are:

. link:{source-root}/servicetalk-http-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/http/api/StreamingHttpClientFilterFactory.java[Client filter factory].
. link:{source-root}/servicetalk-client-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/client/api/LoadBalancerFactory.java[Load balancer factory].
. link:{source-root}/servicetalk-http-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/http/api/StreamingHttpConnectionFilterFactory.java[Connection filter factory].
. link:{source-root}/servicetalk-http-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/http/api/StreamingHttpServiceFilterFactory.java[Service filter factory].
. link:{source-root}/servicetalk-transport-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/transport/api/ConnectionAcceptorFactory.java[Connection acceptor factory].
. link:{source-root}/servicetalk-http-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/http/api/StreamingHttpService.java[Service].

However, these entities do not always contain blocking code. If these entities and the entities they create which are
invoked by ServiceTalk do not contain any blocking code, then they can opt-in to the offload optimization by
implementing
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-http-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/http/api/HttpExecutionStrategyInfluencer.java[`HttpExecutionStrategyInfluencer`].
If they do, ServiceTalk will include these entities in the process of calculating the optimized offload strategy.
ServiceTalk provided filters follow this model themselves, eg:
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-opentracing-http/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/opentracing/http/TracingHttpRequesterFilter.java[`TracingHttpRequesterFilter`]
and link:{source-root}/servicetalk-http-utils/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/http/utils/RedirectingHttpRequesterFilter.java[`RedirectingHttpRequesterFilter`].

== Evolving to asynchronous

Blocking programming model is easy to start and understand but it may not be the correct tool for all scenarios.
In fact, ServiceTalk assumes that applications typically have a mixed profile where different parts follow different
xref:{page-version}@servicetalk::programming-paradigms.adoc[Programming Paradigms]. One of the goals of
ServiceTalk is to help users evolve from a blocking programming model to a completely asynchronous programming model
without the need to completely rewrite the entire application. The process for this evolution is elaborated in
xref:evolve-to-async.adoc[this document].
