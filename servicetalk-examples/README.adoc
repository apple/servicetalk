== ServiceTalk examples

This repository is a collection of examples on how to use different facets of ServiceTalk.
See the https://docs.servicetalk.io/[ServiceTalk docs] for more information.

Note that these projects use direct references to other ServiceTalk projects, as shown here:

[source,groovy]
----
implementation project(":servicetalk-annotations")
implementation project(":servicetalk-http-netty")
implementation project(":servicetalk-http-utils")
----

Standalone projects using ServiceTalk will reference the ServiceTalk modules using standard artifacts coordinates as
shown below. A separate https://github.com/servicetalk/examples[ServiceTalk examples repository] demonstrates how to
reference ServiceTalk modules in typical projects.

[source,groovy]
----
// `servicetalk-dependencies` brings consistent versions of ServiceTalk modules and required external dependencies
implementation platform("io.servicetalk:servicetalk-dependencies:$serviceTalkVersion")

// The version for all ServiceTalk dependencies will be resolved based on information in `servicetalk-dependencies`.
implementation "io.servicetalk:servicetalk-annotations"
implementation "io.servicetalk:servicetalk-http-netty"
implementation "io.servicetalk:servicetalk-http-utils"
