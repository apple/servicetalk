== ServiceTalk examples

This repository is a collection of examples on how to use different facets of ServiceTalk.
See the https://docs.servicetalk.io/[ServiceTalk docs] for more information.

Note that these projects use direct references to other ServiceTalk projects,
as shown here:

[source,groovy]
----
implementation project(":servicetalk-annotations")
implementation project(":servicetalk-http-netty")
implementation project(":servicetalk-http-utils")
----

In actual user projects, ServiceTalk modules would be referenced via standard artifacts coordinates,
with the versions managed thanks to the provided BOM, as demonstrated here:

[source,groovy]
----
// `servicetalk-bom` brings consistent versions of ServiceTalk modules.
implementation platform("io.servicetalk:servicetalk-bom:$serviceTalkVersion")

// The version for all ServiceTalk dependencies will be resolved based on information in `servicetalk-bom`.
implementation "io.servicetalk:servicetalk-annotations"
implementation "io.servicetalk:servicetalk-http-netty"
implementation "io.servicetalk:servicetalk-http-utils"
----
