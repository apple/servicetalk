= HTTP Examples

The link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http[`http`]
folder contains examples for the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231[HTTP] protocol.

[#HelloWorld]
== Hello World

An obligatory "Hello World" example for HTTP.

=== Asynchronous + Aggregated

This example demonstrates asynchronous request processing where the payload body is aggregated into a single object
instead of a stream.

* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/async/HelloWorldServer.java[HelloWorldServer] - a server that demonstrates the asynchronous API and
responds with a simple `Hello World!` response body as a `text/plain`.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/async/HelloWorldClient.java[HelloWorldClient] - a client that sends a `GET` request to the
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/async/HelloWorldServer.java[server] and receives the response as a single content.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/async/HelloWorldUrlClient.java[HelloWorldUrlClient] - a client that sends a `GET` request to the
specified URL in absolute-form and receives the response as a single content.

=== Asynchronous + Streaming

This example demonstrates asynchronous request processing where the payload body is a stream.

* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/async/streaming/HelloWorldStreamingServer.java[HelloWorldStreamingServer] - a server that responds with a
stream of `text/plain` payload body for every request.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/async/streaming/HelloWorldStreamingClient.java[HelloWorldStreamingClient] - a client that sends a `GET`
request to the link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/async/streaming/HelloWorldStreamingServer.java[server] and receives the response payload
body as a stream of buffers.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/async/streaming/HelloWorldStreamingUrlClient.java[HelloWorldStreamingUrlClient] - a client that sends a
`GET` request to the specified URL in absolute-form and receives the response payload body as a stream of buffers.

[#blocking-aggregated]
=== Blocking + Aggregated

This example demonstrates blocking request processing where the payload body is aggregated into a single object. The
APIs will block if content is requested but there is no content available.

* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/blocking/BlockingHelloWorldServer.java[BlockingHelloWorldServer] - a server that demonstrates the
blocking API and responds with a simple `Hello World!` response body as a `text/plain`.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/blocking/BlockingHelloWorldClient.java[BlockingHelloWorldClient] - a client that sends a `GET` request to
the link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/blocking/BlockingHelloWorldServer.java[server] and receives the response payload body as one aggregated
object.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/blocking/BlockingHelloWorldUrlClient.java[BlockingHelloWorldUrlClient] - a client that sends a `GET`
request to the specified URL in absolute-form and receives the response payload body as one aggregated object.

=== Blocking + Streaming

This example demonstrates blocking request processing where the payload body is a blocking iterable stream.

* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/blocking/streaming/BlockingHelloWorldStreamingServer.java[BlockingHelloWorldStreamingServer] - a server
that responds with an iterable stream of `text/plain` payload body for every request.

that sends a `GET` request to the link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/blocking/streaming/BlockingHelloWorldStreamingServer.java[server] and
receives the response payload body as a blocking iterable stream of buffers.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/helloworld/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/helloworld/blocking/streaming/BlockingHelloWorldStreamingUrlClient.java[BlockingHelloWorldStreamingUrlClient] - a
client that sends a `GET` request to the specified URL in absolute-form and receives the response payload body as a
blocking iterable stream of buffers.

[#Compression]
== Compression

Extends the async "Hello World" example to demonstrate content encoding compression filters. No separate example is
needed for the other API variants as the usage of content encoding filters is the same for all API styles.

* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/compression/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/compression/CompressionFilterExampleServer.java[CompressionFilterExampleServer] - a server that demonstrates
the asynchronous API and responds with a simple `Hello World!` response body, optionally customized for a specific name for `POST` requests, as a `text/plain`.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/compression/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/compression/CompressionFilterExampleClient.java[CompressionFilterExampleClient.java] - a client that
sends a `POST` request containing a name to the link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/compression/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/compression/CompressionFilterExampleServer.java[server] and
receives a response greeting the posted name as a single content.

[#Debugging]
== Debugging

Extends the async "Hello World" example to demonstrate some useful features available
 for debugging ServiceTalk applications. You should read and understand the async "Hello World"
 example first to understand the additions this example adds. No separate example is needed
 for the other API variants as the usage of the debugging features are the same for all API
 styles.

* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/debugging/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/debugging/DebuggingExampleServer.java[DebuggingExampleServer] - the async `Hello World!`
 server enhanced with debugging capabilities.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/debugging/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/debugging/DebuggingExampleClient.java[DebuggingExampleClient.java] - the async `Hello World!` client enhanced with debugging capabilities.

[#Timeout]
== Timeout

Extends the async "Hello World" example to demonstrate the use of timeout filters and operators. You should read and
 understand the async "Hello World" example first to understand the additions this example adds. No separate example is
 needed for the other API variants as the usage of the timeout features are the same for all API styles.

* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/timeout/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/timeout/TimeoutServer.java[TimeoutServer] - the async `Hello World!` server client enhanced to use timeout capabilities.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/timeout/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/timeout/TimeoutClient.java[TimeoutClient.java] - the async `Hello World!` client enhanced to use timeout capabilities.

[#Serialization]
== Serialization

An example similar to "Hello World" examples, which demonstrates
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/serialization/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/serialization/async[asynchronous-aggregated],
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/serialization/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/serialization/async/streaming[asynchronous-streaming],
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/serialization/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/serialization/blocking[blocking-aggregated], and
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/serialization/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/serialization/blocking/streaming[blocking-streaming]
client and server with JSON serialization of simple pojo classes.

Client sends a `POST` request with a JSON payload link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/serialization/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/serialization/CreatePojoRequest.java[PojoRequest] and expects a response
with `Content-Type: application/json` and link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/serialization/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/serialization/PojoResponse.java[MyPojo] as a payload.

[#JAXRS]
== JAX-RS

ServiceTalk provides a JAX-RS implementation that can plugin to ServiceTalk APIs.
This example demonstrates how to use these APIs, and how different API variations (e.g. asynchronous/blocking and
aggregated/streaming) are exposed.

=== Hello world

A simple "Hello World" example built using JAX-RS.

* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/jaxrs/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/jaxrs/HelloWorldJaxRsServer.java[HelloWorldJaxRsServer] - a JAX-RS based hello world server that demonstrates how to
write blocking as well as asynchronous resource methods.
* link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/jaxrs/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/jaxrs/HelloWorldJaxRsResource.java[HelloWorldJaxRsResource] - a JAX-RS resource having different methods for
blocking and asynchronous interactions.

This example does not have a client yet but one can use curl to send requests like:

----
curl http://localhost:8080/greetings/hello
----

More examples of how to use the resource can be found in the
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/jaxrs/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/jaxrs/HelloWorldJaxRsResource.java[HelloWorldJaxRsResource] javadocs.

[#MetaData]
== MetaData

This example demonstrates some basic functionality of the
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-http-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/http/api/HttpMetaData.java[HttpMetaData] classes:

- Setting and getting response status.
- Setting and getting query parameters.
- Setting, checking, and getting headers.
- Printing headers without redaction/filtering.

Using the following classes:

- link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/metadata/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/metadata/MetaDataDemoServer.java[MetaDataDemoServer] - A server that provides greetings in various languages.
- link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/metadata/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/metadata/MetaDataDemoClient.java[MetaDataDemoClient] - A client that requests greetings in various languages.

NOTE: This example uses the link:#blocking-aggregated[blocking + aggregated] API, as the metadata API is the same
across all the HTTP APIs.

[#Mutual-TLS]
== Mutual TLS

This example demonstrates how client and server can be configured to do mutual authentication via TLS.

Using the following classes:

- link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/mutual-tls/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/mutualtls/HttpServerMutualTLS.java[HttpServerMutualTLS] - A server that sets the trust manager and key manager, and requires client authentication.
- link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/mutual-tls/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/mutualtls/HttpClientMutualTLS.java[HttpClientMutualTLS] - A client that sets the trust manager and key manager.

NOTE: This example uses the link:#blocking-aggregated[blocking + aggregated] API, as the TLS/SSL configuration API is
the same across all the HTTP APIs.

[#HTTP2]
== HTTP/2

These examples demonstrate how users can configure link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540[HTTP/2] transport in
ServiceTalk.

=== HTTP/2 with Prior-Knowledge

This example demonstrates how to configure using
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-3.4[HTTP/2 transport with Prior-Knowledge] for HTTP clients and servers:

- link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/http2/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/http2/priorknowledge/Http2PriorKnowledgeServer.java[Http2PriorKnowledgeServer] -
A server that uses HTTP/2 with Prior Knowledge.
- link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/http2/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/http2/priorknowledge/Http2PriorKnowledgeClient.java[Http2PriorKnowledgeClient] -
A client that uses HTTP/2 with Prior Knowledge.

=== HTTP/2 via ALPN for secure connections

For secure TLS connections link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301[ALPN extension] could be used to negotiate the
communication protocol:

- link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/http2/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/http2/alpn/HttpServerWithAlpn.java[HttpServerWithAlpn] -
A server that negotiates HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1 using ALPN extension for TLS connections.
- link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/http2/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/examples/http/http2/alpn/HttpClientWithAlpn.java[HttpClientWithAlpn] -
A client that negotiates HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1 using ALPN extension for TLS connections.

If HTTP/1.x protocol is configured ServiceTalk always fallbacks to it if the peer does not support ALPN extension.

IMPORTANT: Your runtime must support ALPN extension for TLS. The recommended way is to use OpenSSL provider and add
link:https://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html#artifacts[netty-tcnative] artifact to the classpath. If OpenSSL is
not available, make sure your JVM version supports ALPN or use
link:https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/alpn-chapter.html[another provider] that supports it.

NOTE: These examples use the link:#blocking-aggregated[blocking + aggregated] API for demonstration purposes, as the
builder API is the same across all the HTTP APIs.

== Service Composition

An advanced example which demonstrates a composition of various ServiceTalks services in one application.
For more information see xref:http/service-composition.adoc[Service Composition].

[#uds]
== Unix Domain Sockets (UDS)

This example demonstrates how client and server can use unix domain sockets. See
the link:{source-root}/servicetalk-examples/http/uds[uds example code] for more details.

NOTE: This example uses the link:#blocking-aggregated[blocking + aggregated] API, as the UDS configuration API is the
same across all the HTTP APIs.
