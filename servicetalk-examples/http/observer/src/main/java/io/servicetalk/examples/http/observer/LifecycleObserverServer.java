                // 1. Configuring it at the builder gives maximum visibility and captures entire request-response state,
                // including all filters and exception mappers.
                .lifecycleObserver(observer)
                // 2. Configuring it as a filter allows users to change the ordering of the observer compare to other
                // filters or make it conditional. This might be helpful in a few scenarios such as when the tracking
                // scope should be limited or when logging should include tracing/MDC context set by other preceding
                // filters. See javadoc of HttpLifecycleObserverServiceFilter for more details.
                // 2.a. At any position compare to other filters before offloading:
                // .appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter(new HttpLifecycleObserverServiceFilter(observer))
                // 2.b. At any position compare to other filters after offloading:
                // .appendServiceFilter(new HttpLifecycleObserverServiceFilter(observer))
