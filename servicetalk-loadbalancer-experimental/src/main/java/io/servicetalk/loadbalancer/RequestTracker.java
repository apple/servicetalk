/**
 * A tracker of latency of an action over time.
 * <p>
 * The usage of the RequestTracker is intended to follow the simple workflow:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>At initiation of an action that will be tracked the caller must call
 *     {@link RequestTracker#beforeRequestStart()} and save the timestamp much like would be done when using a stamped
 *     lock.</li>
 *     <li>Once the request event is complete only one of the {@link RequestTracker#onRequestSuccess(long)} or
 *     {@link RequestTracker#onRequestError(long, ErrorClass)} methods must be called and called exactly once</li>
 * </ul>
 * In other words, every call to {@link RequestTracker#beforeRequestStart()} must be followed by exactly one call to
 * either of the completion methods {@link RequestTracker#onRequestSuccess(long)} or
 * {@link RequestTracker#onRequestError(long, ErrorClass)}. Failure to do so can cause state corruption in the
 * {@link RequestTracker} implementations which may track not just latency but also the outstanding requests.
