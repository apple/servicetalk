/**
 * A tracker of latency of an action over time.
 * <p>
 * The usage of the RequestTracker is intended to follow the simple workflow:
 * - At initiation of an action for which a request is must call {@link RequestTracker#beforeStart()} and save the
 *   timestamp much like would be done when using a stamped lock.
 * - Once the request event is complete only one of the {@link RequestTracker#onSuccess(long)} or
 *   {@link RequestTracker#onError(long, ErrorClass)} methods must be called and called exactly once.
 * In other words, every call to {@link RequestTracker#beforeStart()} must be followed by exactly one call to either of
 * the completion methods {@link RequestTracker#onSuccess(long)} or
 * {@link RequestTracker#onError(long, ErrorClass)}. Failure to do so can cause state corruption in the
 * {@link RequestTracker} implementations which may track not just latency but also the outstanding requests.
