 * Interface abstracting away the method of host selection.

 * Thread Safety
 * Because the HostSelector is used on the hot path some care must be paid to thread safety. The easiest
 * pattern to use is to make the internal state effectively immutable and rebuilds (see below) generate new
 * immutable instances as necessary. The interface is expected to adhere to the following rules:
 *
 * <li>The {@link HostSelector#selectConnection(Predicate, ContextMap, boolean)} method will be used
 * concurrently with calls to itself as well as calls to {@link HostSelector#rebuildWithHosts(List)}.</li>
 * <li>The {@link HostSelector#rebuildWithHosts(List)} will only be called sequentially with respect to itself.</li>
 * <p>
 * Note that the HostSelector does not own the provided {@link Host}s and therefore should not
 * attempt to manage their lifecycle.
