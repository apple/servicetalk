/**
 * Builder for {@link LoadBalancerFactory} that creates {@link LoadBalancer} instances based upon the configuration.
 * <p>
 * The addresses are provided via the {@link Publisher published}
 * {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent events} that signal the host's {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status status}.
 * Instances returned handle {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#AVAILABLE},
 * {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#EXPIRED}, and {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#UNAVAILABLE} event statuses.
 * <p>
 * The created instances have the following behaviour:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Host selection is performed based upon the provided {@link LoadBalancingPolicy}. If no policy is provided
 *     the default policy is round-robin. While it can be policy specific, most policies will avoid unhealthy
 *     hosts.</li>
 *     <li>Host health is determined by the configured {@link OutlierDetectorConfig}. This is inferred from the
 *     results of requests and from actively probing for connectivity in accordance with the config.</li>
 *     <li>Connections are created lazily, without any concurrency control on their creation. This can lead to
 *     over-provisioning connections when dealing with a requests surge.</li>
 *     <li>Existing connections are reused unless a selector passed to
 *     {@link LoadBalancer#selectConnection(Predicate, ContextMap)} suggests otherwise. This can lead to situations
 *     where connections will be used to their maximum capacity (for example in the context of pipelining) before new
 *     connections are created.</li>
 *     <li>Closed connections are automatically pruned.</li>
 *     <li>When {@link Publisher}&lt;{@link ServiceDiscovererEvent}&gt; delivers events with
 *     {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent#status()} of value {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#UNAVAILABLE}, connections
 *     are immediately closed (gracefully) for the associated {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent#address()}. In case of
 *     {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#EXPIRED}, already established connections to
 *     {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent#address()} continue to be used for requests, but no new connections are created.
 *     In case the address' connections are busy, another host is tried. If all hosts are busy based on the selection
 *     mechanism of the {@link LoadBalancingPolicy}, selection fails with a
 *     {@link io.servicetalk.client.api.NoActiveHostException}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <ResolvedAddress> The resolved address type.
 * @param <C> The type of connection.
