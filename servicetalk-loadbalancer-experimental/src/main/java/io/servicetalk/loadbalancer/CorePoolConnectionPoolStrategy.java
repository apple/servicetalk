/**
 * A connection selection strategy that prioritizes a configurable "core" pool.
 * <p>
 * This {@link ConnectionPoolStrategy} attempts to emulate the pooling behavior often seen in thread pools.
 * Specifically it allows for the configuration of a "core pool" size which are intended to be long-lived.
 * Iteration starts in the core pool at a random position and then iterates through the entire core pool before
 * moving to an overflow pool. Because iteration of this core pool starts at a random position the core connections
 * will get an even traffic load and, because they are equally selectable, will tend not to be removed due to idleness.
 * <p>
 * If the core pool cannot satisfy the load traffic can spill over to extra connections which are selected in-order.
 * This has the property of minimizing traffic to the latest elements added outside the core pool size, thus let
 * them idle out of the pool once they're no longer necessary.
 *
 * @param <C> the concrete type of the {@link LoadBalancedConnection}.
