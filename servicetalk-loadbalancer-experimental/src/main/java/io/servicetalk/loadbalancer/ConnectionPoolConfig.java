     * This {@link ConnectionPoolStrategy} attempts to emulate the pooling behavior often seen in thread pools.
     * Specifically it allows for the configuration of a "core pool" size which are intended to be long-lived.
     * Iteration starts in the core pool at a random position and then iterates through the entire core pool before
     * moving to an overflow pool. Because iteration of this core pool starts at a random position the core connections
     * will get an even traffic load and, because they are equally selectable, will tend not to be removed due to
     * idleness.
     * <p>
     * If the core pool cannot satisfy the load traffic can spill over to extra connections which are selected in-order.
     * This has the property of minimizing traffic to the latest elements added outside the core pool size, thus let
     * them idle out of the pool once they're no longer necessary.
     *
     * @param corePoolSize the size of the core pool.
     * @param forceCorePool whether to avoid selecting connections from the core pool until it has reached the
     *                      configured core pool size.
