/**
 * A random selection "power of two choices" load balancing policy.
 * <p>
 * This {@link LoadBalancer} selection algorithm is based on work by Michael David Mitzenmacher in The Power of Two
 * Choices in Randomized Load Balancing.
 * <p>
 * This load balancing policy is characterized by the algorithm:
 * - select two hosts randomly: hosta, and hostb.
 * - if neither host is healthy, repeat selection process until max-effort.
 * - pick the 'best' host of the two options.
 * @param <ResolvedAddress> the type of the resolved address.
 * @param <C> the type of the load balanced connection.
 * @see <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/tpds2001.pdf">Mitzenmacher (2001) The Power of Two
 *    Choices in Randomized Load Balancing</a>
