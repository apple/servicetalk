/**
 * An {@link Iterator} that is also an {@link AutoCloseable}.
 * <p>
 *     This interface is meant to be used in places where an {@link Iterator} contains state that is required to be
 *     cleared irrespective of whether data from the {@link Iterator} is completely consumed
 *     (i.e. {@link Iterator#hasNext()} is called till it returns {@code false}) or not.
 *     This interface provides a way for a user of such an {@link Iterator} to discard data, by calling
 *     {@link #close()}.
 *     When using {@link CloseableIterator}, it is expected that the user will either consume all the data from the
 *     {@link Iterator} or explicitly call {@link AutoCloseable#close()} to dispose the remaining data.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of elements returned by this {@link CloseableIterator}.
