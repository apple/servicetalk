 * A contract capable of deserializing a stream of {@link Buffer}s into a stream of {@link T}s.

 * <p>
 * Implementations are assumed to be stateful since a single {@link Buffer} may not hold
 * enough data to deserialize an entire object. It is expected that {@link #deserialize(Buffer)} or
 * {@link #deserialize(Iterable)} may be called multiple times to deserialize a single instance of {@link T} as more
 * data is available.
