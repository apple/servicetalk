/**
 * An HTTP requester filter that tracks events during gRPC request/response lifecycle.
 * <p>
 * The result of the observed behavior will depend on the position of this filter in the execution chain.
 * This filter is recommended to be appended as the <b>first</b>
 * {@link SingleAddressHttpClientBuilder#appendClientFilter(StreamingHttpClientFilterFactory) client filter} using
 * {@link GrpcClientBuilder#initializeHttp(GrpcClientBuilder.HttpInitializer)} to account for all work done by other
 * filters. It can be appended at another position, considering the following:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>After a tracing filter or any other filter that populates
 *     {@link HttpRequestMetaData#context() request context}, {@link AsyncContext}, {@link MDC}, or alters
 *     {@link HttpRequestMetaData} if that information has to be available for {@link GrpcExchangeObserver}.</li>
 *     <li>After {@link RetryingHttpRequesterFilter} if each retry attempt should be observed as an independent
 *     {@link GrpcExchangeObserver exchange}.</li>
 *     <li>As a {@link SingleAddressHttpClientBuilder#appendConnectionFilter(StreamingHttpConnectionFilterFactory)
 *     connection filter} if no user-defined {@link RetryingHttpRequesterFilter} is appended manually but the default
 *     auto-retries should be observed as an independent {@link GrpcExchangeObserver exchange}.</li>
 *     <li>As the last
 *     {@link SingleAddressHttpClientBuilder#appendConnectionFilter(StreamingHttpConnectionFilterFactory) connection
 *     filter} if only network interactions should be observed without accounting for work of any other filters.</li>
 *     <li>After {@link TimeoutHttpRequesterFilter} (or {@link GrpcFilters#newGrpcDeadlineClientFilterFactory()}) if the
 *     timeout event should be observed as {@link GrpcExchangeObserver#onResponseCancel() cancellation} instead of an
 *     {@link GrpcExchangeObserver#onResponseError(Throwable) error}.</li>
 *     <li>Before any filter that populates {@link HttpResponseMetaData#context() response context} or alters
 *     {@link HttpResponseMetaData} if that information has to be available for {@link GrpcExchangeObserver}.</li>
 *     <li>Before any filter that maps/translates {@link HttpResponseMetaData} into an {@link Throwable exception} or
 *     throws an exception during {@link StreamingHttpResponse#transformPayloadBody(UnaryOperator) response payload body
 *     transformation} if that exception has to be observed by {@link GrpcExchangeObserver}.</li>
 *     <li>Using
 *     {@link SingleAddressHttpClientBuilder#appendClientFilter(Predicate, StreamingHttpClientFilterFactory)} or
 *     {@link SingleAddressHttpClientBuilder#appendConnectionFilter(Predicate, StreamingHttpConnectionFilterFactory)} if
 *     the observer should be applied conditionally.</li>
