/**
 * An HTTP service filter that tracks events during gRPC request/response lifecycle.
 * <p>
 * The recommended approach is to use {@link GrpcServerBuilder#lifecycleObserver(GrpcLifecycleObserver)} to configure
 * an observer that captures entire state of the request processing. In cases when an observer should be moved down in
 * a filter chain or applied conditionally, this filter can be used.
 * <p>
 * This filter is recommended to be appended as the first filter at the
 * {@link HttpServerBuilder#appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter(StreamingHttpServiceFilterFactory)}
 * or {@link  HttpServerBuilder#appendServiceFilter(StreamingHttpServiceFilterFactory)}
 * (which can be configured using {@link GrpcServerBuilder#initializeHttp(GrpcServerBuilder.HttpInitializer)})
 * to account for all work done by other filters. If it's preferred to get visibility to information populated by other
 * filters (like tracing keys), it can be appended after those filters.
