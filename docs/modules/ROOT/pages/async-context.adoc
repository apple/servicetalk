= Async context

ServiceTalk is a fully asynchronous framework and therefore multiple requests may be multiplexed on the same thread.
Also depending on the application's threading model a single request may be processed on different threads. This means
that libraries that rely upon ThreadLocal storage such as http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#mdc[`MDC`] would not work as
expected. To overcome this limitation, we provide an abstraction called `AsyncContext` which hooks into the internal
async machinery to make sure thread local context data is propagated along with the request.

Although `AsyncContext` may be convenient to use it shouldn't be overused when traditional argument passing is an
option. The intended use case of `AsyncContext` is to propagate context across method boundaries which do not
accommodate for additional parameters. This is typically applicable for infrastructure tasks like tracing,
logging, etc.

`AsyncContext` is designed to provide a static API to retain state associated across asynchronous boundaries. A static
API has a few benefits:

**Interop with existing APIs depending on `ThreadLocal`**

Some APIs / features assume static state that is coupled with the current thread. This worked well in the
1-request-per-thread model, however it breaks down when we may process a request on different threads due to
asynchronous execution and also share threads for processing different requests. For example the
link:https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java/blob/master/opentracing-api/src/main/java/io/opentracing/Tracer.java[OpenTracing APIs]
and the
link:http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/MDC.html[MDC APIs] assume state is stored in some static structure.

**API is decoupled from application data APIs**

A use case for `AsyncContext` is to retain distributed tracing state. This state maybe useful across different APIs
and maybe burdensome to account for this state in every API (e.g. gRPC and generated code). It also maybe error prone to
rely upon users to propagate this state according to control flow which may result inconsistent state. This state is
often optional and not always required, and so if it is baked into the protocol APIs this would make them more complex
and not be required.

NOTE: This maybe seen as a negative in some respects. On the contrary, this does not restrict users from explicitly
passing state through their APIs.

However, these benefits don't come for free. Some costs of the static API are as follows:

**Complexity of implementation**

ServiceTalk is on the hook for making sure the state is saved/restored across asynchronous boundaries. This means
that ReactiveStreams operators, Executors, and the offloading strategy must account for when relying upon
`AsyncContext`. In order to accomplish this ServiceTalk's asynchronous control flow needs to account for `AsyncContext`
and provide tools for users if they have existing code outside ServiceTalk control flow.

**Understandability**

Although asynchronous function composition is not required to use ServiceTalk, the internals of ServiceTalk uses
asynchronous function composition as a core abstraction which can be difficult to reason about relative to
traditional imperative programming. On top of this, ServiceTalk provides isolation from the EventLoop
threads by offloading to application level threads, which introduces asynchronous boundaries. For request/response
protocols the goal is for the `AsyncContext` to be isolated for each request/response, but folks that need to directly
interact with `AsyncContext` need to understand how modifications are visible (or not) relative to where they are set.

**Cost of retention**

In order to make state available in a static fashion across API calls the mechanism to do this is to use thread local
state. The same thread maybe used to process logically independent asynchronous control flows (e.g. EventLoop can
process multiple sockets, and each socket can process multiple requests, and offloading may re-use threads to process
different requests). This results in frequently accessing the thread local state to save original value, set correct
context, and then restore original value.

== Usage

ServiceTalk provides out-of-the-box support for `AsyncContext`, details about which can be found
xref:{page-version}@servicetalk-concurrent-api::async-context.adoc[here]. Users can
xref:{page-version}@servicetalk-concurrent-api::async-context.adoc#disable-asynccontext[disable `AsyncContext`] if they
do not require this functionality.
