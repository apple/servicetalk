= Asynchronous Context

ServiceTalk is a fully asynchronous framework and therefore multiple requests may be multiplexed on the same thread.
Also, depending on the application's threading model, a single request may be processed on different threads. This means
that libraries that rely upon `ThreadLocal` storage such as https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#mdc[`MDC`] would not work
as expected. To overcome this limitation, we provide an abstractions called `AsyncContext` and `CapturedContext` which
hooks into the internal async machinery to make sure thread local context data is propagated along with the request.

== Working with Asynchronous Context

**API is decoupled from application data APIs**

A key use case of contextual information is to pass data "through" some APIs that are otherwise oblivious to the data
so that it can be used at deeper layers in the application. This state maybe useful across different APIs and maybe
burdensome to account for this state in every API (e.g. gRPC and generated code). It also maybe error-prone to
rely upon users to propagate this state according to control flow which may result inconsistent state. This state is
often optional and not always required, and so if it is baked into the protocol APIs this would make them more complex
and not be required.

To overcome this limitation, we provide two abstractions to propagate context asynchronously: `AsyncContext`, which is
intended to replace custom `ThreadLocal` definitions, and `CapturedContext` which is used to capture third-party
context information. This allows programs to decouple values from the exact API call chain by using static APIs to get
and set values.

However, these benefits don't come for free. Some costs of the static API are as follows:

**Complexity of implementation**

ServiceTalk is on the hook for making sure the state is saved/restored across asynchronous boundaries. This means
that ReactiveStreams operators, Executors, and the offloading strategy must account for when relying upon
asynchronous context. In order to accomplish this ServiceTalk's asynchronous control flow needs to provide tools for
users if they have existing code outside ServiceTalk control flow.

**Understandability**

Although asynchronous function composition is not required to use ServiceTalk, the internals of ServiceTalk uses
asynchronous function composition as a core abstraction which can be difficult to reason about relative to
traditional imperative programming. On top of this, ServiceTalk provides isolation from the I/O
threads by offloading to application level threads, which introduces asynchronous boundaries. For request/response
protocols the goal is for the asynchronous context to be isolated for each request/response, but folks that need to
directly interact with asynchronous context need to understand how modifications are visible (or not) relative to where
they are set or read in their application.

== `AsyncContext`

Although `AsyncContext` may be convenient to use it shouldn't be overused when traditional argument passing is an
option. The intended use case of `AsyncContext` is to propagate context across API boundaries which do not accommodate
for additional parameters.

`AsyncContext` is designed to provide a static API to retain state associated across asynchronous boundaries that can
be used instead of creating a traditional `ThreadLocal`.

**Cost of retention**

In order to make state available in a static fashion across API calls the mechanism to do this is to use thread local
state. The same thread maybe used to process logically independent asynchronous control flows (e.g. I/O threads can
process multiple sockets, and each socket can process multiple requests, and offloading may re-use threads to process
different requests). This results in frequently accessing the thread local state to save original value, set correct
context, and then restore original value.

=== Usage

ServiceTalk provides out-of-the-box support for `AsyncContext`, details about which can be found
xref:{page-version}@servicetalk-concurrent-api::async-context.adoc[here]. Users can
xref:{page-version}@servicetalk-concurrent-api::async-context.adoc#disable-asynccontext[disable `AsyncContext`] if they
do not require this functionality.

== `CapturedContext`

In contrast to the `AsyncContext`, the `CapturedContext` APIs are most suitable for capturing external context and
restoring it within the ServiceTalk execution chain. It is _not_ a good tool for defining new contextual information.

**Interop with existing APIs depending on `ThreadLocal`**

Some APIs / features assume static state that is coupled with the current thread. This worked well in the
thread-per-request model, however it breaks down when we may process a request on different threads due to
asynchronous execution and also share threads for processing different requests. For example the
link:https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/api/all/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/api/trace/Span.java[OpenTelemetry APIs]
and the
link:https://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/MDC.html[MDC APIs] assume state is stored in some static structure. The
`CapturedContext` APIs can be used to capture `ThreadLocal` state, pass it along asynchronous boundaries, and restore
it in the ServiceTalk execution chain. This has the further advantage of not being 'infectious': using `CaptureContext`
does not dictate the behavior of the third-party storage model and makes it more likely to interact correctly with
other libraries.

**Cost of retention**

To understand the cost of the context capture and restore process, we need to understand when and how it happens.
Context capture happens during the subscribe operation of the ServiceTalk concurrent APIs making capture relatively
infrequent. In contrast, context restoration happens on every interaction of the ServiceTalk concurrent APIs: this
includes when data is available as well as when errors and cancellation occurs. Every time context needs to be saved or
restored the existing needs to be captured, the expected state must be restored, the work is done, and finally the
pre-existing state is restored once more. This means that if the save or restore processes are expensive, such as
clearing and adding elements to a map, then there will be a high cost to propagating the context. On the other hand, if
the capture and restore process is simple, such as getting and setting values in a `ThreadLocal`, the cost will be
relatively low.

=== Usage

The `CapturedContext` APIs are used via hooks are loaded via the `Providers` mechanism, which is backed by the Java
`java.util.ServiceLoader`. This involves creating a
`CapturedContextProvider` that will be used as part of the ServiceTalk context capture and restore process. For details
about how to capture and restore custom context see the example in
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-concurrent-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/api/CapturedContextProvider.java[CapturedContextProvider].
ServiceTalk uses this mechanism for its OpenTelemetry integration. See
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-opentelemetry-asynccontext/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/opentelemetry/asynccontext/OtelCapturedContextProvider.java[OtelCapturedContextProvider].
