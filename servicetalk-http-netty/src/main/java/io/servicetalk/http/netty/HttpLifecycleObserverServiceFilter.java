/**
 * An HTTP service filter that tracks events during request/response lifecycle.
 * <p>
 * When this filter is used the result of the observed behavior will depend on the position of the filter in the
 * execution chain. Moving it before or after other filters, such as {@link TimeoutHttpServiceFilter}, may result in
 * different {@link HttpLifecycleObserver} callbacks being triggered
 * (seeing {@link HttpResponseObserver#onResponseCancel()} vs {@link  HttpResponseObserver#onResponseError(Throwable)}).
 * If any of the prior filters short circuit the request processing or modify {@link HttpResponseMetaData}, those won't
 * be observed. Presence of the tracing or MDC information also depends on position of this filter compare to filters
 * that populate context.
 * <p>
 * If observing the real {@link HttpResponseStatus} returned from the server is desired, consider using
 * {@link HttpServerBuilder#lifecycleObserver(HttpLifecycleObserver)} instead or place
 * {@link HttpExceptionMapperServiceFilter} right after this filter to make sure all {@link Throwable}(s) are mapped
 * into an HTTP response.
