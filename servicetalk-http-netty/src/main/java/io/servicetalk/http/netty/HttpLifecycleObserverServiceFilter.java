/**
 * An HTTP service filter that tracks events during request/response lifecycle.
 * <p>
 * The result of the observed behavior will depend on the position of this filter in the execution chain.
 * This filter is recommended to be appended as one of the first filters using
 * {@link HttpServerBuilder#appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter(StreamingHttpServiceFilterFactory)} method to account for
 * all work done by other filters and offloading of the requests processing. It can be appended at another position,
 * considering the following:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>After a tracing filter or any other filter that populates
 *     {@link HttpRequestMetaData#context() request context}, {@link AsyncContext}, {@link MDC}, or alters
 *     {@link HttpRequestMetaData} if that information has to be available for {@link HttpExchangeObserver}.</li>
 *     <li>After {@link TimeoutHttpRequesterFilter} if the timeout event should be observed as
 *     {@link HttpExchangeObserver#onResponseCancel() cancellation} instead of an
 *     {@link HttpExchangeObserver#onResponseError(Throwable) error}.</li>
 *     <li>After any filter that can reject requests, like {@link BasicAuthHttpServiceFilter}, if only allowed requests
 *     should be observed.</li>
 *     <li>Before any filter that can reject requests, like {@link BasicAuthHttpServiceFilter}, if all incoming requests
 *     have to be observed.</li>
 *     <li>Before any filter that populates {@link HttpResponseMetaData#context() response context} or alters
 *     {@link HttpResponseMetaData} if that information has to be available for {@link HttpExchangeObserver}.</li>
 *     <li>Before any filter that maps/translates {@link HttpResponseMetaData} into an {@link Throwable exception} or
 *     throws an exception during {@link StreamingHttpResponse#transformPayloadBody(UnaryOperator) response payload body
 *     transformation} if that exception has to be observed by {@link HttpExchangeObserver}.</li>
 *     <li>Before any exception mapping filter that maps an {@link Throwable exception} into a valid response, like
 *     {@link HttpExceptionMapperServiceFilter}, if the {@link HttpExchangeObserver} should see what status code is
 *     returned to the client.</li>
 *     <li>Using {@link HttpServerBuilder#appendServiceFilter(StreamingHttpServiceFilterFactory)} if an exchange
 *     should be observed after it's offloaded from an {@link IoExecutor} (if offloading is enabled).</li>
 *     <li>Using
 *     {@link HttpServerBuilder#appendNonOffloadingServiceFilter(Predicate, StreamingHttpServiceFilterFactory)} or
 *     {@link HttpServerBuilder#appendServiceFilter(Predicate, StreamingHttpServiceFilterFactory)} if the observer
 *     should be applied conditionally.</li>
 *     <li>As the last {@link HttpServerBuilder#appendServiceFilter(StreamingHttpServiceFilterFactory)} if only service
 *     business logic should be observed without accounting for work of any other filters.</li>
 * </ul>
 * An alternative way to install an {@link HttpLifecycleObserver} is to use
 * {@link HttpServerBuilder#lifecycleObserver(HttpLifecycleObserver)}.

 * @see HttpServerBuilder#lifecycleObserver(HttpLifecycleObserver)
