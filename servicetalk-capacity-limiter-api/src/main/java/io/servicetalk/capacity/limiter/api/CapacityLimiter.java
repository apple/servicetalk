/**
 * A provider of capacity for a client or server.
 * <br><br>
 * <h2>Capacity</h2>
 * Capacity for an entity is defined as the number of concurrent requests that it can process without significantly
 * affecting resource consumption or likelihood to successfully process in a timely manner given currently
 * available resources vs resources required to process the new request.
 * This capacity offered can be static or dynamic and the semantics of determination is left to implementations.
 * <br><br>
 * <h2>Consumption</h2>
 * As the capacity is defined in terms of concurrent requests, as {@link #tryAcquire(Classification, ContextMap)
 * new requests are seen}, some portion of this capacity is deemed to be consumed till a subsequent callback marks
 * the end of processing for that request. Number of times that {@link #tryAcquire(Classification, ContextMap)}
 * is called without a corresponding termination callback is termed as demand.
 * <br><br>
 * <h2>Request Lifetime</h2>
 * Request processing starts when {@link #tryAcquire(Classification, ContextMap)} is called and returns a non-null
 * {@link Ticket} and terminates when either one of the following occurs:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When the request is successfully completed =&gt; (Default: {@link Ticket#completed()})
 *     <li>When the request fails due to an external capacity rejection i.e., dropped =&gt; (Default:
 *     {@link Ticket#dropped()})
 *     </li>
 *     <li>When the request fails due to a local error =&gt; (Default: {@link Ticket#failed(Throwable)})
 *     <li>When the request is cancelled (Default: {@link Ticket#dropped()})
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <h2>Request Classifications</h2>
 * Requests can be classified with different classes, that can be taken into consideration when a
 * {@link CapacityLimiter} implementation supports this.
 * {@link Classification} is used as hint from the user of the importance of the incoming request, and are not
 * guaranteed to have an influence to the decision if the {@link CapacityLimiter} doesn't support them or chooses to
 * ignore them.
