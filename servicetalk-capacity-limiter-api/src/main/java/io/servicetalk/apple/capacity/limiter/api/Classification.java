 * Classification of requests.
 * <p>
 * In the context of capacity, classification can be used to allow prioritization of requests under
 * certain conditions. When a system is load-shedding, it can still choose to accommodate important demand.
 * The classification is not a feature supported by all {@link CapacityLimiter}s but rather the
 * {@link CapacityLimiter} of preference needs to support it. For {@link CapacityLimiter}s that classification
 * is not supported, if a classification is provided it will be discarded.
 * <p>
 * It's not the purpose of this interface to define characteristics or expectations of the currently available or
 * future supported classifications. This is an implementation detail of the respective {@link CapacityLimiter}.
 * <p>
 * Classification is treated as a hint for a {@link CapacityLimiter} and are expected to be strictly respected,
 * they are a best effort approach to communicate user's desire to the {@link CapacityLimiter}.
