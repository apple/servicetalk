= OpenTelemetry Async Context

ServiceTalk provides OpenTelemetry integration through async context propagation that ensures OpenTelemetry context and spans are properly maintained across asynchronous boundaries.

== Overview

The `servicetalk-opentelemetry-asynccontext` module provides the link:{source-root}/servicetalk-opentelemetry-asynccontext/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/opentelemetry/asynccontext/OtelCapturedContextProvider.java[OtelCapturedContextProvider] which integrates OpenTelemetry's context propagation with ServiceTalk's xref:{page-version}@servicetalk-concurrent-api::async-context.adoc[Asynchronous Context] system.

== Key Features

* **Automatic Context Propagation**: OpenTelemetry context is automatically captured and restored across ServiceTalk's asynchronous boundaries
* **Thread Safety**: Works correctly in ServiceTalk's multi-threaded, asynchronous execution model
* **Zero Configuration**: Automatically discovered and enabled via Java's ServiceLoader mechanism

== Usage

This module is typically used in conjunction with the `servicetalk-opentelemetry-http` module to provide end-to-end tracing for HTTP services and clients.

For detailed usage examples, see the OpenTelemetry examples in the ServiceTalk examples module.
