= ServiceTalk Data Jackson Jersey

This module provides Jackson-based JSON serialization and deserialization for ServiceTalk Jersey router.
It is a replacement for `jersey-media-json-jackson` and allows avoiding the input stream adaptation that kicks in
with out-of-the-box body readers and also allows accepting/returning `Single<Pojo>` and `Publisher<Pojo>`
from resource methods.

See the link:https://docs.servicetalk.io/[ServiceTalk docs] for more information.
