/**
 * Base class for all operators on a {@link Completable} that do not process any signal asynchronously.
 *
 * <h2>Caution</h2>
 * This is an optimized path that omits wrapping the {@link Subscriber} for each operator in an execution chain.
 * If this is used in an operator which creates/consumes new asynchronous sources (eg: flatmap), it will make the
 * processing chain (after this operator) susceptible to blocking code running on eventloops. Such operators MUST use
 * {@link AbstractAsynchronousCompletableOperator} instead.
