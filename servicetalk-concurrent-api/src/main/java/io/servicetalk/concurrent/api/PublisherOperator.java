/**
 * An operator contract for a {@link Publisher}.
 * Logically an operator sits between a {@link Publisher} and a {@link Subscriber} and hence it has two
 * responsibilities:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Subscribe to the {@link Publisher} on which this operator is applied.</li>
 *     <li>Accept a {@link Subscriber} that subscribes to this operator.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * So, an operator can be defined as a {@link Function} that takes a {@link Subscriber} and returns a
 * {@link Subscriber}. The {@link Subscriber} that is passed to this {@link Function} is the one that has subscribed to
 * this operator. The {@link Subscriber} that is returned by this {@link Function} is the one that should be used to
 * subscribe to the {@link Publisher} on which this operator is applied.
 *
 * @param <T> Type of items emitted by the {@link Publisher} this operator is applied.
 * @param <R> Type of items emitted by this operator.
