 * A holder of items for a {@link Processor}. A {@link Processor} decouples {@link Subscriber production of data} from
 * the {@link Processor#subscribe(Subscriber) consumption of data} and this holder acts as the implementation for that
 * decoupling by using an intermediate in-memory storage. This in-memory storage layer can be used in different ways,
 * some of which are enumerated below:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Implement a custom signal rejection strategy when some signals can be dropped in favor of others.</li>
 *     <li>Store reduced set of signals when intermediary signals can either be discarded or coalesced.</li>
 *     <li>Reverse order of consumption of items when stored signals reach a threshold.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Multi-threaded access</h2>
 * Implementations may assume that the consumption of the holder (methods {@link #tryConsume(ProcessorSignalsConsumer)}
 * and {@link #tryConsumeTerminal(ProcessorSignalsConsumer)}) is always done serially however the production (methods
 * {@link #add(Object)}, {@link #terminate(Throwable)} and {@link #terminate()}) can be done concurrently.
