= Blocking support

== Motivation

We want ServiceTalk to be easy to approach but the pitfall of inadvertently blocking the event loop is subtle and hard
to understand. This pitfall reduces the target audience because users have to know about the internal threading model in
order to avoid increasing latency/throughput for what may seem like unrelated operations that happen to share the same
event loop. Users also have to know what constitutes "blocking", and even if they are aware of the implications of
blocking, it is not necessarily a straightforward task to determine if third party libraries will block. For these
reasons we want ServiceTalk to be "safe by default" and ServiceTalk shouldn't prevent imperative blocking code from
working as expected nor inadvertently introduce latency.

== What is blocking?

Before understanding what it takes to supporting blocking operations in ServiceTalk, it is important to determine what
constitutes as a *safe* blocking operation. Our intent is *not* to guarantee forward progress for arbitrary of user
code. Instead we guarantee forward progress for user code that would otherwise guarantee forward progress in a strictly
sequential program.

=== Execution chain

Any ServiceTalk asynchronous source (`Publisher`, `Single` and `Completable`) offers multiple operators that can be
applied to the source. Any instance of such a source and all the operators applied to it before it is subscribed, is
called an execution chain.

=== Data and control flow in an execution chain

The image below details the flow of data (`Subscriber` methods) and control (`Publisher` and `Subscription` methods)
messages. Invocations in either direction may be executed on an event loop thread and hence needs to be protected. In
case new asynchronous sources are generated/received inside operators, they follow the same model and hence are removed
for brevity.

image::BlockingScenarios.jpg[Data and control flow in an execution chain]

As shown in the above picture, there are inherently two directions (data and control) of information flow for an
execution chain and these
link:https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.2/README.md#glossary[signals] can be triggered
in parallel.

*By default, in ServiceTalk, signals are not executed on an event loop thread, but instead executed using a thread
provided by the application in the order they are received*. In most scenarios the same application thread is used for
the data and control path, but some operators may not always exhibit this behavior. This means by default there is
typically no concurrency between the data and control path. It is possible to <<Opt Out>> and have user code executed on
the event loop thread, and in this case data and control signals may be concurrent.

==== Implications

The implication of the above approach is the following:

**Users can execute blocking code inside an execution chain, provided they are not waiting for another data or control
message in the same execution chain.**

Look at <<Pitfalls>> section for examples elaborating this implication.

== Goals

=== Blocking work

Out of the box, anyone using any ServiceTalk API should be allowed to execute blocking code without inadvertently
blocking an event loop thread. Points at which such code could be written are the following:

* Inside any function provided to the operators on an asynchronous source (`Publisher`, `Single`, `Completable`).
* Inside a server handler (accepting new connections or requests, based on the protocol).
* Inside the `handleSubscribe` method of a user created asynchronous source.
* Inside user `Subscriber` methods.
* Inside user `Subscription` methods.

=== Thread Affinity

In ServiceTalk different protocols will provide request processing by means of an asynchronous source, eg: `Single`.
In such cases, this processing will be expressed as a chain of operators on the asynchronous source. Configuring limits
on resources such as a thread pool can be challenging if **each** operator in the chain may run on different threads.
This would mean applying limits to such a thread pool would be sensitive to program's execution flow and may change over
time. In order to make thread pool configuration easier, ServiceTalk provides thread affinity for each subscription to
all asynchronous sources.

==== Affinity for an asynchronous source

Let us assume that following expresses request processing:

[source, java]
----
 client.request() # <1>
       .map(resp -> {
            return doSomeBlockingWorkAndConvertToString(resp); # <2>
       })
       .filter(stringResp -> {
            doMoreBlockingWorkToFilterString(stringResp); # <3>
       });
----
<1> A hypothetical client which provides a `request()` method that returns a `Single<Response>`.
<2> Some blocking work done inside `map()` operator by this function, which provides a String as a response.
<3> Some more blocking work inside `filter()` operator.

In the above example user provided functions inside both `map()` and `filter()` will be invoked in the **same thread per
each subscription**. Threads may be re-used by different subscriptions, but not used concurrently.

==== Affinity across asynchronous sources

Thread affinity across asynchronous sources is not guaranteed **even if they are part of the same processing chain**.

Let us assume that following expresses request processing:

[source, java]
----
 client.request() # <1>
       .map(resp -> {
            return doSomeBlockingWorkAndConvertToString(resp); # <2>
       })
       .flatmap(stringResp -> {
            return client2.request(stringResp) # <3>
                          .map(resp -> {
                            doSomeBlockingWorkAgain(); # <4>
                          });
       })
       .filter(stringResp -> {
            doMoreBlockingWorkToFilterString(stringResp); # <5>
       });
----
<1> A hypothetical client which provides a `request()` method that returns a `Single<Response>`.
<2> Some blocking work done inside `map()` operator by this function, which provides a String as a response.
<3> Call another `client2` that provides a new `Single` which is returned from `flatmap`.
<4> Do some blocking work inside `map()` operator for the nested `Single` returned by Step (3).
<5> Some more blocking work inside `filter()` operator.

In the above example (2), (3) and (5) will run on one thread whereas (4) will run on a different thread.

=== Blocking primitives

JDK provides well understood constructs for blocking operations, eg: `Iterator`s, `InputStream`, etc. and ServiceTalk
will provide a rich set of adapters from our asynchronous primitives to these constructs and vice-versa. The goal is to
provide a familiar API and a strong interoperability story for java blocking libraries.

== Pitfalls

As defined in <<What is blocking?>>, ServiceTalk sequences events in data and control path of processing as if they were
done on the same thread. Since, data and control events may happen in parallel, there is always a chance for user code
to deadlock if they are executed in sequence.

[source, java]
----
    CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1); # <1>
    Publisher.from(1, 2, 3, 4)
            .doAfterNext(integer -> {
                latch.countDown();  # <2>
            })
            .doBeforeRequest(requestN -> {
                latch.await(); # <3>
            });
----
<1> Hypothetical synchronization point. In real life it may be due to the code waiting for an event to happen externally.
<2> Trigger the external event (hypothetical synchronization point of `CountDownLatch`) **after** receiving the item.
<3> Wait for the external event to happen (hypothetical synchronization point of `CountDownLatch`) **before** sending
`requestN` to the `Publisher`.

As per ReactiveStreams link:https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm#1.1[rule 1.1], request for items
**MUST** happen before the items are delivered. In the above code, we are waiting for an item to be emitted before
sending a request to the `Publisher`. This results in a deadlock as an item can not be emitted by the source without a
request being received and user code making sure that the request is not sent before an item is emitted.

In order to avoid such scenarios, it is handy to follow certain best practices while writing blocking code in operators:

- Avoid co-ordination between two operators on the same source.
- If such co-ordination is required, try limiting such coordination in either data or control path but not
inter-dependent on each other.
- If co-ordination is required between data and control path, be aware of ReactiveStreams semantics and how the two
paths interact with each other.

If these rules are followed the above example can be modified to:

[source, java]
----
    CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
    Publisher.from(1, 2, 3, 4)
            .doAfterNext(integer -> {
                latch.countDown();
            })
            .doAfterRequest(requestN -> { # <1>
                latch.await();
            });
----
<1> Use `doAfterRequest` which happens **after** `requestN` is delivered to the source.

In this modified example, since we now use `doAfterRequest`, instead of `doBeforeRequest`, we do not block `requestN` to
go to the source and this code is safe.

== Opt Out

In some cases, advanced users who wish to opt-out of the default blocking support, can do so per asynchronous source.
Note that opting out should be done at the user's own risk. If you opt out it is assumed you are aware of the event loop
threading model used for I/O processing, the implications of blocking an event loop thread, and be sure you do not
execute any "blocking" code on an event loop thread.

== Implementation

In order to use ServiceTalk's blocking support feature, one does not need to know about implementation details and the
above information is sufficient. However, if you are developing some operators in ServiceTalk or are just curious,
link:BlockingImplementation.adoc[BlockingImplementation.adoc] describes the design.
