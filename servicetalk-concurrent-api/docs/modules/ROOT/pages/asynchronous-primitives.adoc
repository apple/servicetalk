= Asynchronous Primitives

ServiceTalk provides different java interfaces to represent asynchronous operations with different result cardinalities,
namely:

- No result, just termination (link:{source-root}/servicetalk-concurrent-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/api/Completable.java[`Completable`]).
- Exactly one result (link:{source-root}/servicetalk-concurrent-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/api/Single.java[`Single`]).
- Zero or many results (link:{source-root}/servicetalk-concurrent-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/api/Publisher.java[`Publisher`]).

These interfaces are also referred to as asynchronous **primitives** or asynchronous **sources** in this document.

== Interoperability

ServiceTalk **follows** the
link:https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.3/README.md#specification[ReactiveStreams Specification]
to define its own asynchronous primitives. Since there are more than one standards, namely:
link:https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.3/README.md#specification[ReactiveStreams Specification]
and link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html[JDK Flow], ServiceTalk decouples itself
from a specific standard by defining its own <<Specifications, primitives>> instead of directly using a specific
standard. In order to make sure we are following the specifications correctly, we verify our sources using the
link:https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.3/tck[ReactiveStreams TCK]. For interoperability
we provide ReactiveStreams
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-concurrent-reactivestreams/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/reactivestreams/ReactiveStreamsAdapters.java[adapters]
and JDK Flow link:{source-root}/servicetalk-concurrent-jdkflow/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/jdkflow/JdkFlowAdapters.java[adapters].

== Lazy execution

All asynchronous primitives provided by ServiceTalk are "lazy"/"cold" such that the work
they represent does not start until someone is "listening"
(a.k.a link:https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.3/README.md#api-components[subscribed])
for the results. This is different from "eager"/"hot"
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[CompletableFuture] usages
where the work being done to complete the
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[CompletableFuture] has
already started regardless of anyone "listening" for the results.

The lazy/cold approach has the following benefits:

* __Avoid internal queuing__: For streaming operations, starting an operation without an associated listener, requires
queuing till a listener is available. Lazy execution avoids this queuing.
* __Implicit work association__: Since the asynchronous source is expected to start work only when a listener is
available, there is an implicit association between the source and the work it represents. This subtle change is
powerful as it means that work can be re-done without invoking the method that created the source. Thus enabling us to
generically implement retries on the sources as opposed to the methods that create the sources.

== Specifications

As defined <<Interoperability, above>>, ServiceTalk defines its own interfaces (specifications consistent with the
link:https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.3/README.md#specification[ReactiveStreams Specification])
for the different asynchronous primitives. These interfaces define the minimum API required to represent that
asynchronous primitive and their names are suffixed by the term `Source`. Primary motivation for defining these
specifications is the ability to inter-operate between different standards.

IMPORTANT: Specification interfaces are mentioned here for completeness, typical users are not expected to use them.
Instead they are expected to use the richer <<primitve-with-operators, asynchronous primitives with operators>>
that hides the complexity of flow control and cancellation while enabling easier expression of application logic.

=== Publisher source

A link:{source-root}/servicetalk-concurrent/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/PublisherSource.java[`PublisherSource`]
is an asynchronous primitive that mimics link:https://www.reactive-streams.org[ReactiveStreams] interfaces and is
designed to be used when the source may produce zero or potentially infinite number of results.

=== Single source

A link:{source-root}/servicetalk-concurrent/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/SingleSource.java[`SingleSource`]
is an asynchronous primitive that is designed to be used when the source will produce exactly one result or terminate
with an error.

=== Completable source

A link:{source-root}/servicetalk-concurrent/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/CompletableSource.java[`CompletableSource`]
is an asynchronous primitive that is designed to be used when the source will complete or terminate with an error.

[#async-control-flow]
== Asynchronous control flow

An important part of writing an application is to have the ability to express control flow like retries, error handling,
combining multiple operations sequentially or in parallel. Asynchronous programming is especially challenging
when expressing complex control flow and without higher level abstractions can quickly lead to nested, complex callback
logic colloquially known as the __Callback hell__. Error propagation, cancellation and backpressure is extremely complex
to wire through this control flow and leads to subtle issues in applications.

Although <<Specifications, specification interfaces>> express the asynchronous primitives completely, they do not address
the common concern of expressing asynchronous control flow effectively, making them less useful for direct consumption
by most applications. Neither ReactiveStreams, nor JDK Flow provides higher level abstractions that address this problem.
This creates an opportunities for libraries like ServiceTalk to provide these higher level abstraction.
The industry has a rich history of using function composition based control flow from Common Lisp and Erlang to more
targeted approach in the reactive domain such as link:https://reactivex.io[ReactiveX],
link:https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core[Project reactor], and
link:https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/operators/index.html[Akka streams]. Function composition is an approach
to define common control-flow primitives as functions which are used together with the asynchronous primitives.
These functions are commonly referred to as **operators**.

[#operators]
== Operators

ServiceTalk limits <<Specifications, specification interfaces>> to define the contract for all asynchronous primitives
and adds operators as part of the <<primitve-with-operators, asynchronous primitives with operators>>. Although
ServiceTalk developers referenced the eco-system
(link:https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html[ReactiveX Operators],
link:https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/operators/index.html[Akka streams operators],
link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-streams-operators[Microprofile operators],
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html[JDK Streams] and
link:https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core[Project reactor]) for existing conventions, there is currently no de-facto
standard governing operator names. More details on ServiceTalk operators can be found in our
xref:{page-version}@servicetalk::javadoc/index.adoc[Javadocs].

[#primitve-with-operators]
== Asynchronous primitives with operators

These primitives are an extension of <<Specifications, specification interfaces>> and they add operators to the
corresponding specification interface. ServiceTalk always provides these rich sources from its APIs making it easier for
users to use those APIs.
