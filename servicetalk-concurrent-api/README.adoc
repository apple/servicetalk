# ServiceTalk Concurrent API

This package provides the concurrent API for ServiceTalk based applicaitons. Included are Reactive
Streams extensions and operator implementations. Please see the
https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/master/README.md[`Reactive Streams Specification`]
for definitions and rules regarding concurrency.

# Async Context

## Introduction

ServiceTalk is a fully asynchronous framework and therefore multiple requests
may be multiplexed on the same thread. Also depending on the application's
threading model a single request may be processed on different threads. This
means that `ThreadLocal` and derivatives such as https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#mdc[`MDC`]
would not work as expected. To overcome this limitation, we provide an
`AsyncContext` which hooks into the internal async machinery to make sure
thread local context data is propagated along with the request.

Although `AsyncContext` may be convenient to use it shouldn't be over used
when traditional argument passing is an option. The intended use case of
`AsyncContext` is to propagate context across method boundaries which do not
accommodate for additional parameters. This is typically applicable for
infrastructure like tasks (e.g. tracing, logging, etc...).

## Basics

`AsyncContext` provides a map-like storage scoped to each request. The first
step to storing something in the `AsyncContext` is to create a global `Key`
(note that it is `AsyncContextMap.Key` instead of `AsyncContext.Key`):

```java
public static final AsyncContextMap.Key<String> TRACE_ID_KEY = new AsyncContextMap.Key<>("traceId");
```

Now the key can be used to read or write values from the current context:

```java
AsyncContext.put(TRACE_ID_KEY, "12345");
assert "12345".equals(AsyncContext.get(TRACE_ID_KEY));
```

When a request is received ServiceTalk sets up a new empty context. A typical
use case is to extract debugging information from the request and put them in
the current `AsyncContext` where they can be referenced later in logs or traces:

```java
HttpService service = (ctx, in) -> {
  AsyncContext.put(TRACE_ID_KEY, in.headers().get("X-TraceId"));
  return handleRequest(in);
};

Single<HttpResponse> handleRequest(HttpRequest req) {
  logger.info("Handling request {}", AsyncContext.get(TRACE_ID_KEY));
  return fetchFromDatabase()
    .map(v -> {
      logger.info("Decoding result {}", AsyncContext.get(TRACE_ID_KEY));
      return decode(v);
    })
    .doFinally(() -> {
      logger.info("Finalizing request {}", AsyncContext.get(TRACE_ID_KEY));
    });
}
```

In the example above, `handleRequest`, `fetchFromDatabase` and the `map`
/ `doFinally` operators may run in different threads, but they will all see
the same `AsyncContext`. The `AsyncContext` is automatically propagated into
`Single`, `Completable` and `Publisher` sources and operator methods.

## Interop with third party APIs

Sometimes you may need to interact with an asynchronous third party API which
doesn't use the ServiceTalk async primitives (`Single`, `Completable`,
`Publisher`). `AsyncContext` provides some wrapping methods which
can be used to wrap `Runnable`, `Consumer`, etc.

```java
class ThirdPartyClient {
  CompletionStage doStuffAsync();
}

ThirdPartyClient client = ...;

void myCode() {
  AsyncContext.put(key, value);

  client.doStuffAsync()
    .thenAccept(AsyncContext.wrap(value -> {
      // here AsyncContext.get(key) == value
    });
}
```

## Extensions

We provide a number of extensions to simplify integration with other libraries.

### servicetalk-rxjava-context

`servicetalk-rxjava-context` hooks into RxJava to ensure `AsyncContext` is
also propagated into RxJava operator methods.

Usage:

```java
RxJavaContextHooks.install(); // this must be called once at startup
```

```java
AsyncContext.put(key, value);

Observable.create(e -> ...)
  .map(v -> {
    // here AsyncContext.get(key) == value
  });
```

### servicetalk-log4j2-mdc

`servicetalk-log4j2-mdc` sets up the Log4j 2 `MDC` / `ThreadContext` so
that it is propagated together with `AsyncContext`. This allows you to add
diagnostic information to logs without having to call `AsyncContext.get()`
repeatedly. Using `servicetalk-log4j2-mdc`, the tracing example above
can be simplified as:

```java
HttpService service = (ctx, in) -> {
  MDC.put("traceId", in.headers().get("X-TraceId"));
  return handleRequest(in);
};

Single<HttpResponse> handleRequest(HttpRequest req) {
  logger.info("Handling request");
  return fetchFromDatabase()
    .map(v -> {
      logger.info("Decoding result");
      return decode(v);
    })
    .doFinally(() -> {
      logger.info("Finalizing request");
    });
}
```

The MDC adapter is discovered automatically by Log4j 2, but you may need to
configure Log4j 2 to include MDC values in logs.

## How it works

It is useful to understand the mechanism of `AsyncContext` propagation at a
high level. Note that the exact implementation is subject to change so you
should not depend on implementation details. This section is mainly for helping
you build up a mental model.

Internally the `AsyncContext` is implemented as a copy-on-write `ThreadLocal`
map. When a `Single`, `Completable`, or `Publisher` is subscribed,
the current `AsyncContext` is saved and used to wrap the subscriber. The saved
`AsyncContext` will be temporarily restored when methods on the subscriber are
invoked. Here is a simplified example of the wrapping process:

```java
Single single = new Single() {
  @Override
  protected void onSubscribe(Subscriber subscriber) {
    AsyncContext saved = AsyncContext.current();
    Subscriber wrappedSubscriber = new Subscriber() {
      @Override
      public void onSubscribe(Cancellable cancellale) {
        AsyncContext.replace(saved);
        subscriber.onSubscribe(value);
      }

      @Override
      public void onSuccess(Object value) {
        AsyncContext.replace(saved);
        subscriber.onSuccess(value);
      }

      @Override
      public void onError(Throwable t) {
        AsyncContext.replace(saved);
        subscriber.onError(t);
      }
    };
    // we will call wrappedListener for now on
    // ...
  }
}
```

There are two important implications of this design. First of all the wrapping
is done once per subscribe instead of when the async source (`Single`/
`Completable`/`Publisher`) is created. This allows `AsyncContext` to work with
cold async sources:

```java
Single resultRecipe = new Single...
  .doFinally(v -> {
    logger.info("This is for request {}", AsyncContext.get(key));
  });

HttpService service = (ctx, in) -> {
  AsyncContext.put(key, in.headers().get("X-TraceId"));
  return resultRecipe;
}
```

This would print out one line for each request:

```
This is for request df0c5b75f73f3867
This is for request 90e1b9b7fc074164
...
```

Secondly, since operators on async sources are implemented as chained listeners/
subscribers, when a source is subscribed it will subscribe all the way
to the ultimate source and capture the context in all operators. As an example
consider this code:

```java
AsyncContext.put(key, value);

new Publisher...
  .map(v -> ...)
  .doFinally(() -> ...);
  .subscribe(sub);
```

When `subscribe` is called on the `Publisher` returned by `doFinally`, it will
trigger a subscribe on `map`, which in turns trigger a subscribe on the ultimate
source defined by `new Publisher`. The `AsyncContext` containg `key=value`
will be captured and used to wrap all layers of operators.
