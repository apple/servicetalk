/**
 * {@link LoadBalancerFactory} that creates {@link LoadBalancer} instances which use a round robin strategy
 * for selecting addresses. The created instances have the following behaviour:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Round robining is done at address level.</li>
 * <li>Connections are created lazily, without any concurrency control on their creation.
 * This can lead to over-provisioning connections when dealing with a requests surge.</li>
 * <li>Existing connections are reused unless a selector passed to {@link LoadBalancer#selectConnection(Predicate)}
 * suggests otherwise. This can lead to situations where connections will be used to their maximum capacity
 * (for example in the context of pipelining) before new connections are created.</li>
 * <li>Closed connections are automatically pruned.</li>
 * <li>If {@link #eagerConnectionShutdown} is set to {@code true}, connections are immediately closed
 * for an {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent#isAvailable() unavailable} address. When {@code false} is used, connections
 * to addresses marked as {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent#isAvailable() unavailable} are used for requests,
 * but no new connections are created for them. In case the address' connections are busy, another host is tried.
 * If all hosts are busy, selection fails with a {@link io.servicetalk.client.api.ConnectionRejectedException}.</li>
 * <li>For hosts to which consecutive connection attempts fail, a background health checking task is created and
 * the host is not considered for opening new connections until the background check succeeds to create a connection.
 * Upon such event, the connection can immediately be reused and future attempts will again consider this host.
 * This behaviour can be disabled using a negative argument for
 * {@link Builder#healthCheckFailedConnectionsThreshold(int)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <ResolvedAddress> The resolved address type.
 * @param <C> The type of connection.
