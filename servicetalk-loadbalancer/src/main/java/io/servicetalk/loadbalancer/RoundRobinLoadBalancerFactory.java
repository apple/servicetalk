/**
 * {@link LoadBalancerFactory} that creates {@link LoadBalancer} instances which use a round robin strategy
 * for selecting connections from a pool of addresses. The addresses are provided via the {@link Publisher published}
 * {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent events} that signal the host's {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status status}.
 * Instances returned handle {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#AVAILABLE},
 * {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#EXPIRED}, and {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#UNAVAILABLE} event statuses.
 * <p>The created instances have the following behaviour:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Round robining is done at address level.</li>
 * <li>Connections are created lazily, without any concurrency control on their creation.
 * This can lead to over-provisioning connections when dealing with a requests surge.</li>
 * <li>Existing connections are reused unless a selector passed to {@link LoadBalancer#selectConnection(Predicate)}
 * suggests otherwise. This can lead to situations where connections will be used to their maximum capacity
 * (for example in the context of pipelining) before new connections are created.</li>
 * <li>Closed connections are automatically pruned.</li>
 * <li>When {@link Publisher}&lt;{@link ServiceDiscovererEvent}&gt; delivers events with
 * {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent#status()} of value {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#UNAVAILABLE}, connections
 * are immediately closed for the associated {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent#address()}. In case of
 * {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent.Status#EXPIRED}, already established connections to
 * {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent#address()} are used for requests, but no new connections are created.
 * In case the address' connections are busy, another host is tried. If all hosts are busy, selection fails with a
 * {@link io.servicetalk.client.api.ConnectionRejectedException}.</li>
 * <li>For hosts to which consecutive connection attempts fail, a background health checking task is created and
 * the host is not considered for opening new connections until the background check succeeds to create a connection.
 * Upon such event, the connection can immediately be reused and future attempts will again consider this host.
 * This behaviour can be disabled using a negative argument for
 * {@link Builder#healthCheckFailedConnectionsThreshold(int)} and the failing host will take part in the regular
 * round robin cycle for trying to establish a connection on the request path.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <ResolvedAddress> The resolved address type.
 * @param <C> The type of connection.
