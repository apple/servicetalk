/**
 * An observer interface that provides visibility into gRPC lifecycle events.
 * <p>
 * In order to deliver events at accurate time, callbacks on this interface can be invoked from the {@link IoExecutor}.
 * Implementation of this observer <b>must</b> be non-blocking. If the
 * consumer of events may block (uses a blocking library or
 * <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/async.html">logger configuration is not async</a>), it has to
 * offload publications to another {@link Executor} <b>after</b> capturing timing of events. If blocking code is
 * executed inside callbacks without offloading, it will negatively impact {@link IoExecutor}.
 * <p>
 * To install this observer for the server use {@link GrpcServerBuilder#lifecycleObserver(GrpcLifecycleObserver)}, for
 * the client use {@link GrpcClientBuilder#appendHttpClientFilter(StreamingHttpClientFilterFactory)} with
 * {@code io.servicetalk.grpc.netty.GrpcLifecycleObserverRequesterFilter}.
