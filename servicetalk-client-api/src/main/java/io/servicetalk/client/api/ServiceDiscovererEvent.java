/**
 * Notification from the Service Discovery system that availability for an address has changed.
 * <p>
 * Interpreting Events
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When subscribing (or re-subscribing to recovery from faults) to an event stream the initial collection of
 *         events is considered to be the current state of the world.</li>
 *     <li>Each event represents the current state of the {@link ResolvedAddress} overriding any previously known
 *         {@link Status} and any associated meta-data.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Example
 * <p>
 * We can represent a {@link ServiceDiscovererEvent} as map entries of the form
 * ({@link ResolvedAddress}, ({@link Status}, meta-data)) where the {@link ResolvedAddress} is the map key.
 * <pre>
 * Starting with the initial state of {addr1, (AVAILABLE, meta-1)}. Upon subscribing to the event stream the initial
 * state is populated via the event (addr1, (AVAILABLE, meta-1)).
 *
 * Say the meta-data for address changes resulting in a system state {addr1, (AVAILABLE, meta-2)}. The state change is
 * be represented by the event (addr1, (AVAILABLE, meta-2)).
 *
 * Next the address is removed from the system resulting in an empty state {}. It is up to the
 * {@link ServiceDiscoverer} whether this will be represented by the {@link Status#UNAVAILABLE} or
 * {@link Status#EXPIRED} but both are logically equivalent to removal, only with different meanings for how
 * resources already acquired to the address should be used. Picking UNAVAILABLE, the transition back to the empty state
 * would be represented by the event (addr1, (UNAVAILABLE, meta-2)).
 * </pre>
 * See {@link ServiceDiscoverer} for the interface that defines the source of event streams.
 *
 * @param <ResolvedAddress> the type of address after resolution.
