= Service Discovery

A core abstraction in ServiceTalk is its
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-client-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/client/api/ServiceDiscoverer.java[ServiceDiscoverer]
used by the protocol _Clients_ (eg. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, gRPC, etc.).

For scenarios where a client communicates with multiple homogeneous footnote:[belonging to the same service, providing
same capabilities] server instances, managing addresses of multiple server instances for each client is complex.
A ServiceTalk client leverages _ServiceDiscoverer_ to find server instances that it can use for processing requests. A
_ServiceDiscoverer_ finds server instances associated with a logical name. ServiceTalk assumes that the client operates
in a dynamic ephemeral environment and the server instances associated with a logical name may change over time. So, a
_ServiceDiscoverer_ returns a _Publisher_ of
link:{source-root}/servicetalk-client-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/client/api/ServiceDiscovererEvent.java[ServiceDiscovererEvent](s)
that provide information about server instances, their current relationship to the logical name (i.e. whether it is
added or removed from the logical name), and any additional information that is supported by a _ServiceDiscoverer_
implementation. Using this information the xref:{page-version}@servicetalk-loadbalancer::index.adoc[LoadBalancer] of a
_Client_ can maintain an active collections to server instances that it can use.

_ServiceDiscoverer_ is typically not invoked in the request/response path and addresses are resolved "out of band",
a.k.a in the background.

== Implementations

link:{source-root}/servicetalk-client-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/client/api/ServiceDiscoverer.java[ServiceDiscoverer]
abstraction allows for various protocol-independent _Service Discovery_ mechanisms to be implemented. This section will
discuss the various implementations offered in ServiceTalk.

=== Domain Name System (DNS)

link:{source-root}/servicetalk-dns-discovery-netty/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/dns/discovery/netty/DefaultDnsServiceDiscovererBuilder.java[DefaultDnsServiceDiscovererBuilder]
is used to configure and build instances of _ServiceDiscoverer_ that use
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035[Domain Name System (DNS)] to resolve hosts represented by domain name into a
set of IP-addresses needed for _Clients_ to connect to the remote servers. Resolution happens every
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-3.2.1[TTL] seconds.

TIP: This is the default implementation that will be used automatically if no alternative _ServiceDiscoverer_ is
configured when users create a _Client_ instance.

This implementation is backed by `io.netty:netty-resolver-dns` and provides non-blocking DNS resolutions.

IMPORTANT: _macOS_ users may experience problems with resolving host addresses in certain environments. In this case,
users need to add the additional dependency on the classpath which will ensure the right nameservers are selected when
running on macOS: `io.netty:netty-resolver-dns-native-macos:$nettyVersion:osx-x86_64`.
