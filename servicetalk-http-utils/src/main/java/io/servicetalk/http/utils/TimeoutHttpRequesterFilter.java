 * A filter to enable timeouts for HTTP requests on the client-side.

 * payload body and optional trailers.
 *
 * <p>The order with which this filter is applied may be highly significant. For example, appending it before a retry
 * filter would have different results than applying it after the retry filter; timeout would apply for all retries vs
 * timeout per retry.
