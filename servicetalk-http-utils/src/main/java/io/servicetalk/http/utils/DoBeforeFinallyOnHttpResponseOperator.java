/**
 * Helper operator for signaling the end of an HTTP Request/Response cycle.
 *
 * <p>{@link StreamingHttpRequest} and {@link StreamingHttpResponse} are nested sources ({@link Single} of meta-data
 * containing a payload {@link Publisher}), which makes it non-trivial to get a single signal at the end of this
 * Request/Response cycle. One needs to consider and coordinate between the multitude of outcomes: cancel/success/error
 * across both sources.</p>
 * <p>This operator ensures that the provided callback is triggered just once whenever the sources reach a terminal
 * state across both sources.</p>
 *
 * Example usage tracking the begin and end of a request:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     return requester.request(strategy, request)
 *                     .doBeforeSubscribe(__ -> tracker.requestStarted())
 *                     .liftSynchronous(new DoBeforeFinallyOnHttpResponseOperator(tracker::requestFinished));
 * }</pre>
